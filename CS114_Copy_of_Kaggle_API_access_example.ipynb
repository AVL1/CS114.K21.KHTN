hospital ready just in case in South   Carolina we're going to have a baby   there's nothing wrong with that right so   could be any it could be any second that   could even be before I'm finished I mean   but it's but you know she insisted on   being here was so important to ivanka to   insist on being so thank really good   Vanessa Don we have a wonderful   lieutenant governor who backed us very   early in the process you know Henry   right the lieutenant governor of South   Carolina I will take him over the   governor any time because we want me one   [Applause]   he can handle that very nice he's tough   he's very tough Tiffany Erik Lora and   Milania Milania sasa just want to say an   amazing place South Carolina   congratulation to my husband he was   working very hard and he loves you we   love you and to be going ahead to Nevada   and we will see what happened he would   be the best president   [Applause]   and representing some very very   wonderful children ivanka just a fool   Thank You South Carolina this is an   amazing amazing night the momentum since   the beginning of this campaign has been   unbelievable and that's because my   father's message resonates so deeply   with so many people so as our family   we're incredibly proud we're incredibly   grateful to each of you so thank you for   being here to support us and I will say   this my father is an incredibly hard   worker and he'll be working for each and   every one of you so together we'll make   America great again thank you very much   thank you very much so you know i was   watching upstairs and it was really   amazing to be watching what i was   watching and some of the pundits and I   you know overall fair but not too much   but a number of the pundits and well if   a couple of the other candidates dropped   out if you add their scores together   it's going to equal Trump right these   geniuses they're geniuses they don't   understand that as people drop out I'm   going to get a lot of those votes all so   you don't just you're just add them   together   [Applause]   so I think we're going to do very very   well I think we're going to do very well   I want to also congratulate the other   candidates in particular I have to say   Ted and Marco did a really good job and   they got they did quite well as I   understand him and come on just of just   one minute come on one second right good   okay we go back to for tomorrow morning   tomorrow morning we'll be back but I   just want to congratulate the other   candidates there's nothing easy about   running for president I can tell you   it's tough it's nasty its mean it's   vicious it's beautiful when you win it's   beautiful and we're going to start we   are going to start winning for our   country we're gonna start women because   our country does it win anymore doesn't   one we don't win with the military we   can't beat Isis we have great military   but we can't be nice as we don't win on   trade you look at what China is doing to   us what Japan does to us what Mexico is   just killing us at the border at the   border and with trade Mexico is killing   us absolutely will do the wall don't   worry we're going to do the wall we're   going to do the wall and by the way   who's going to pay for the wall Mexico   is going to pay for the world and it's   very easy the other politicians come   down you can't get Mexico to pay for the   wall I said one hundred percent we have   a fifty eight billion dollar trade   deficit with mexico the wall is going to   cause 10 to 12 billion dollars okay   believe me they will pay one of the   officials actually one of the ex   officials from mexico had a news   conference and he announced that we will   not be paying for the wall who does mr.   Trump think he is they came to me the   press these people look at all those   cameras back there the press came to me   and they told me that he said would not   pay for the wall do you have a comment I   said yes the wall just got 10 feet   taller   it's true and I love Mexico I love   Mexico I love China I love many of these   countries that rip us off because we   have leaders that are incompetent and   don't know what they're doing I love   these countries they great I have   thousands and thousands of Hispanics   we're going to Nevada I lead I lead with   the Hispanics I'm leading in every poll   with Hispanics they love me I love them   the problem is the problem is that the   leaders of these countries whether it's   Mexico or Japan or Vietnam which is just   doing a big number now all of a sudden   or China in particular that's the big   one the greatest abuse of a country that   I think I've ever seen financially China   what they've done to us is the greatest   single theft in the history of the world   they've taken our jobs they've taken our   money they've taken everything we're   bringing our jobs back folks we're   bringing our jobs back we're going to   bring them back and I know how to do it   we've had so many we've had so many   incredible endorsements and to me   getting the greatest business people to   endorse me as very important Carl Icahn   endorse me so many others have endorsed   me and we're going to put these great   business people in charge of trade and   when China wants to come and negotiate   they're going to negotiate not with a   political hack which is what they have   now they're going to negotiate with the   best business minds in the world and we   have them in this country   so we're going to do a lot of beautiful   work we're going to terminate Obamacare   it's going to be terminated it's going   to be over it's going to be repealed and   it's going to be replaced and you're   going to have much better health care at   a much smaller cost because Obamacare if   you look look at the increases in your   Obamacare 25 35 45 even fifty five   percent it's dead it's not working we're   going to go to a plan that's going to be   so much better and so much less   expensive so second amendment by the way   this is a room loves the Second   Amendment thank you fellas this is a   room loves and cherishes the Second   Amendment we are going to protect our   Second Amendment   [Applause]   common core is gone we are getting rid   of common core we're bringing education   to a local level the people in this   community every time I see them they   want education locally the parents the   teachers they want to do it they don't   want bureaucrats in Washington telling   them how to educate their children we   spend as a nation more for education /   pupal than any other nation in the world   not even close more per pupil second   place doesn't even exist it's so   different and yet out of 30 countries   were ranked number 30 you have China you   have Norway Sweden Denmark and then you   have number 30 the United States so we   spend the most and we're at the bottom   of the heap it's not going to happen   anymore folks not going to happen   anymore we are going to build our   military which I thank because a number   of the people came down in a number of   the pundits and watching tonight we love   our military   we love our military and by the way we   love our police our police are terrific   we love our police they are not being   treated properly we're going to build   our military so big so good so strong so   powerful that nobody is ever going to   mess with us folks and we're going to   buy we're going to buy the equipment   that our generals are soldiers that   everybody that's in the note want we're   not buying equipment that sells because   they have political well because they   take campaign and they give campaign   contributions we are going to get the   equipment that they want not the   equipment that they're told to have by   senators and congressmen in Washington   we're going to have great equipment and   the reason i can say that is I'm   self-funding my campaign I'm not getting   millions of dollars from all of these   I'm not getting millions of dollars from   all of these special interests and   lobbyists and donors that once they get   it they literally do whatever the   politicians want that's not going to   happen and we're going to take care of   our vets we love our vets and they're   being treated terribly with taking care   of our veterans so we're now off to   Nevada and it's a great state we have   great people we have great people in our   nation no matter where we go I went to   Mobile Alabama 35,000 people we went to   Oklahoma recently twice 20,000 people   20,000 people no matter where we go we   fill up the arenas over here the other   day we had a 9,000 we had a 10,000 we   have people the only thing that stops   the crowds are the walls because we   can't get them in we have to send   thousands of people away Time magazine   Time magazine last week did an   incredible comfort cover story they said   it's a movement and that's what it is   it's an incredible movement with   incredible people incredible people   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   it's an incredible movement with   incredible people I tell you and whether   we go honestly whether we go to Dallas   or whether we go anywhere you say you go   to LA you go anywhere you say our people   are incredible and you know our theme   what's our theme you know it right right   our theme which I love maybe the   greatest theme of all time right and the   word again eventually is going to come   off we're going to get rid of the whole   theme because what's going to happen   make America great again right and the   last two weeks because I've gotten to   see so many I guess millions when you   add them all up with all of these rooms   and all of these speeches and I've met   so many people but the people are so   incredible that I've been saying make   America great again and it's going to be   greater than ever before that's the kind   of potential we have greater than ever   before so so so I want to thank   everybody I love you all again South   Carolina we will never forget you we   will never forget you we will never ever   forget South Carolina we will never   forget our great volunteers we love our   volunteers will never forget all of the   people that have helped us so much my   family and folks let's go let's have a   big win in Nevada let's have a big win   at the SEC let's put this thing away and   let's make America great again thank you   very much thank you very much   you   [Music]   you   [Music]   you

seen before even these   people they talk about it it's one of   the great political phenomena's many of   them have said it even some of them who   truly truly dislike me they've said this   is one of the great phenomenas I mean   look at this place it almost 1 o'clock   in the morning   so I love Michigan and I was the man of   the year or something like four or five   years ago and I came here and have so   many friends in Michigan but I came here   to get the award they asked me to make a   speech I made a speech and I talked   about how Michigan they're ripping your   auto companies apart they're taking you   jobs they're closing your plants they're   moving into Mexico and other places but   mostly to Mexico in this case and I   talked about that and everybody liked me   in Michigan I said but you know we have   to do something about it but I wasn't a   politician but I talked about it and I   kept talking about it and talking about   it and talking and then I see Ford   moving a big plant and then for just two   weeks ago announcing this small cars are   going to be produced and made entirely   in Mexico   and it's getting worse and worse and I   developed a great relationship with the   people of Michigan so the reason I'm   here is that I thought New Hampshire was   going to be my last stage and I heard   that crooked Hillary Clinton was coming   to Michigan I said let's follow it up   and I said there's no place I'd rather   be from my last rally right here in   Michigan late   and   benarjee in life   although this is our last rally of this   campaign it's almost hard to believe we   started a year and a half ago we started   with 17 very talented people governor's   senators dr. ben Carson great guy   lotta talented people and one by one by   one and most of them have been terrific   and give us great support Ben Carson's   one of them as you know but but who   would have thought and now we have one   flawed candidate left to be one flawed   Kappa   it's going to be the very beginning of a   new adventure because the new adventure   we have to win we have to go out and row   but the new adventure is making America   great again we're going to do it   after we win I'm going to be coming back   to Michigan a lot I'm going to be coming   back   every time we open a new factory or a   new automobile plant and we will do it   it will do a lot of expansion we're   going to do a lot of expansion I know   exactly what to do folks we're not going   to lose you jobs anymore we're not going   to lose you job   we are going to bring back the   automobile industry to Michigan bigger   and better and stronger than ever before   you've been mistreated   Michigan now stands at the crossroads of   history   if we win Michigan we will win this   historic election and then we truly will   be able to do all the things we want to   do they won't be taking our jobs any   longer they won't be doing the things   they've been doing to us we'll end up   having great healthcare strong borders   we'll build up our military we have no   choice we have a depleted military we'll   be able to do the things we want to do   when you step into that voting booth   today so today   there is one core question for you to   consider do you want America to be ruled   by the corrupt political class or do you   want America to be ruled by you the   people that's what it is by the people   the way it was supposed to   a long time we've lost track and for   Michigan we will bring back your   automobile production and we will bring   back your industry way do you see what   we do for Michigan   I've been talking about it for a long   time crooked Hillary has not talked   about it folks   she doesn't know where to begin she   talked about bringing industry back to   New York State   when she was a New York state senator   let me tell you not only didn't it come   back look at upstate New York it's a   disaster it got worse people fled   companies fled it's a disaster the   corrupt politicians and their special   interests have ruled over this country   for a very long time   today is our Independence Day   today the American working class is   going to strike back finally real change   begins with immediately repealing and   replacing the disaster known as   Obamacare it's just been announced that   the residents of mission are going to   experience a massive double-digit   premium hike like you wouldn't believe   not going to matter that much honestly   because we're going to terminate it   you're not gonna have to worry about it   ok so well now on the other hand if   something horrible happens tomorrow get   ready to pay a lot more than you're even   paying now but that's not gonna happen   I'm looking at that fantastic young lady   right there   she's shaking her head no way no way not   gonna happen right good not gonna now I   don't think you're gonna have to worry   about the premiums but with Obamacare   premiums is surging companies are   leaving it is yours are fleeing doctors   are quitting and deductibles are going   right through the roof yet Hillary   Clinton wants to double down on   Obamacare making it even more expensive   and it doesn't work it's no good I'm   asking for your vote so we can repeal   and replace Obamacare and save health   for every family in Michigan   [Applause]   we have to do it we don't have a choice   real change also means restoring honesty   to our government so the first thing we   should do let's get rid of Hillary okay   that's probably that would be a very   good first step that's a good first time   Hilary Clinton is the most corrupt   person ever to seek the office of the   presidency of the United States   [Applause]   she is being protected by a totally   rigged system that I've been talking   about for a long time it's a rigged   system now it's up to the American   people to deliver justice at the ballot   box and I don't have to say do it   tomorrow do it in a week you're going to   do it today you're going to sleep for a   couple of hours go to sleep   you go to sleep for a couple of hours   you wake up your castile and then you go   back to sleep or go to work you people   who go to sleep you'll go back to work I   know my people   you'll get up after about two hours   you'll vote and you're going to work   my Michigan people I know I have so many   friends here they work they don't stop   we are finally going to close the   history books on the Clintons and their   lies and schemes and corruption we will   open a bright new chapter focus on you   the American people my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption and to take our   country back from the special interests   I want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear our words our   words when we say you know what we're   going to say we're going to win today   and we're going to Washington DC to   drain the swamp   you probably heard me say it rain the   swamp   it is this beautiful isn't it too bad   that the corrupt media never show the   crowds you know   [Applause]   I think they said 18,000 people here   every corner look at this every corner   and you know they'll say Donald Trump is   speaking before a crowd of people ah   these people are the worst he speaking   in front of a few thousand people   at the core of my contract is my plan to   bring back our jobs the trade policies   of Hillary Clinton from NAFTA to China   to career to the trans-pacific   partnership which by the way is a   disaster have raided your factories   crushed your auto industry and gutted   your communities you know it and she's   not luck folks   honestly you couldn't give her a shot   you're wasting your time you're wasting   your time it's not going to be able to   do the job she's not going to be able to   do the job just look at her record but   forget her record not going to be able   to do the job she doesn't have a clue   Michigan has lost more than one in four   of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a   deal signed by Bill Clinton and   supported by his lovely wife Hillary   by the way you know who I spotted in the   audience mayor Rudolph Giuliani   who needs you   [Applause]   he's got energy that guy he's all over   the place going from place to place the   place got a lot of energy a lot of a lot   of this up here to America has lost   listen to this 70,000 factory 70,000 not   700 not 7000 70,000 factories   since China entered the World Trade   Organization   another Bill and Hillary backed disaster   we are living through the greatest jobs   theft in the history of the world   there's never been anything like this   our jobs are being stolen like candy   from a baby not going to happen anymore   folks they're going to be consequences   they're going to be when they fire our   people our great people who have been   working for 25 30 years of these   companies they fire our people there are   going to be consequences it doesn't work   that way not anymore and the politicians   have been working on this problem for 15   years for 20 years and it's so simple to   sell Delphi laid off three thousand six   hundred and twenty seven workers and   move their jobs to Mexico and other   countries FTE automotive laid off 166   workers in Auburn Hills beautiful place   and move their jobs to Mexico   chrysler later 5300 workers and move   their jobs to Mexico China and other   countries Ford later of 2155 workers and   move their jobs to Mexico and many other   countries now Ford is moving all of its   small car production to Mexico is that   wonderful it used to be the cars were   made in Flint and you couldn't drink the   water in Mexico now the cars are made in   Mexico and you can't drink the damn   water in Flint what   unbelievable   says that true though or what   unbelievable you know I have a friend   he's the biggest in the world at   building plants that's what he does he   builds plants you said build an   apartment he would know what to do he   builds plants the biggest plants and   there were most sophisticated plants all   kinds of plants I said how are you doing   east from this country loves his country   loves his whole area loves you people he   wants to do him here so I said to him   let me ask you how are you doing he said   unbelievable I said oh that's good   that's good   where are you doing well Mexico and so   what about our country not so good   he said Donald you have to see what   we're doing in Mexico we're building   some of the greatest plants anywhere in   the world and I said isn't this sad   isn't this pathetic we're going to   change it around   I want Mexico to build great plans but   we're going to build great plans also   it's got to be a two-way street folks   got to be a two-way street   and right now it's a one lane highway   right into these other countries they   take our money they take our jobs they   build their plants they build their   factories we end up with unemployment   and drugs that's what we end up with not   going to happen any longer a trump   administration will stop the jobs from   leaving America and we will stop the   jobs from leaving Michigan that I can   tell you 100%   if Ford or another company wants to fire   their workers in Michigan and move to   another country and ship their products   back into the United States I will pick   up the phone myself if I can't because I   love it they don't want me to do that   fault I want to do it it's so easy I   love doing it it's like I'm a natural   but I'll have plenty of great   representatives but we we I'm going to   do it every once in a while I don't care   because I love it   we'll be calling the executives at Ford   or whatever company is and we'll tell   them very nicely that if they want to   move their factory or their plan to   another country they will have to pay a   35% tax when they sell their cars or   their product back into the United   States through survey   powerful border so they'll pay attacks   and here's what's going to happen   100% nobody's moving folks they're not   gonna move they're not get a move okay   just think of it don't worry about it   we'll build the wall don't worry   a trump administration will renegotiate   NAFTA and if we don't get the deal we   want we will terminate NAFTA and get a   much better deal for our workers and our   companies a hundred percent we will also   immediately stop the job-killing   trans-pacific partnership which Hillary   Clinton called the gold standard and she   lied look she lied during the debate by   the way did Trump win the debate - Chuck   from the   and by the way he's here did Mike Pence   win the debate   man was that an easy the Bell wasn't   easy was it easy but he certainly made   it look easy didn't he how good is this   Cup Wow honestly I felt so sorry for tim   kaine that was like that was like a   great football team playing your local   high school football players so Hillary   lied about it she said it was the gold   standard and we caught her in the lie   and all of that but when you think about   it it is the gold standard it's the gold   standard for the other countries not for   us for the other countries we're doing   business with can't do it   Hillary will pass the TPP she will   absolutely pass it which will destroy   the rest of the auto industry believe me   it will just walk my words it will   destroy they don't even talk about   currency manipulation in TPP and they   didn't want to because it was taken out   because some of our politicians wanted   to take it out the number one weapon   they wanted to take it out because the   special interests take care of our   politician folks but they're not taking   care of me I've spent a fortune on this   campaign and I'll tell you I told this a   Mike Pence if we don't win because   everyone's saying unbelievable   unbelievable doesn't matter if you win   or lose has never been a movement like   this I said let me just tell you stop   right there   if we don't win this will be the single   greatest waste of time energy and money   in my life we have to win   to do what we have to do we have to win   we can't just have something that looks   wonderful in the history books in 30   years as part of our plan to bring back   jobs we are going to lower taxes on   American business from 35% to 15%   we will massively cut taxes for the   middle class Hillary Clinton wants to   raise your taxes very significantly   think of it we're the highest tax nation   in the world and she wants to raise your   taxes and we will rebuild our inner   cities I know so much about Detroit I   know so much about the inner cities the   african-american community the Hispanic   community has been treated horribly for   a long time the politicians in the case   of the inner cities virtually all   Democrats for over a hundred years   sometimes chained unbroken what they've   done is they come in they get your vote   and then they say see you for years I'll   see you in four years we're going to fix   our inner cities right now they're so   unsafe you walk to the store to pick up   a loaf of bread you get shot you get   shot you know in Chicago thousands and   thousands of shootings since January   first the inner cities are unbelievably   dangerous the education is no good the   safety is horrible and there are no jobs   and I tell everybody what the hell do   you have to lose I'm going to fix it we   will fix   [Applause]   morphix vice president Mike Pence will   be involved and he is so enthused about   this there is such potential we have   such potential in the people I'm talking   about the people there's such potential   there we will fix it remember that we   will become a rich nation once again but   to be a rich nation we must also be a   safe nation Hillary Clinton wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees pouring into our country   and virtually unlimited immigration from   the most dangerous regions of the world   including regions overrun and controlled   by Isis her plan will import generations   of terrorism extremism and radicalism   into your schools and throughout your   communities when I'm elected president   we will suspend the Syrian refugee   program and we will keep radical Islamic   terrorists the hell out of our   we have no choice we have no choice but   we all have big hearts and we will build   safe havens in Syria and we'll get the   Gulf states have nothing but money they   have nothing but money we will get them   to pay for we owe 20 trillion dollars   right now we're not going to pay for it   we're going to get the Gulf states to   pay for we'll manage it will take care   of people but they can't come into our   country we have enough problems okay   here in Michigan you've seen firsthand   the problems caused with the refugee   problem with large numbers of poorly   vetted refugees pouring into your state   without your knowledge without your   support or without your approval nobody   even knows where people are being placed   a Drug Administration will not admit any   refugees without the support of the   local community where they're being   placed a Trump administration will also   secure and defend the borders of the   United States and yes we will build a   great great wall   [Applause]   so I just want to ask you one question   if you don't mind at one o'clock in the   morning who is going to pay for the wall   hundred-person they don't know it yet   but they're going to bed now we're gonna   have a great relationship with Mexico   but right now it's a one-way street we   can't have that we can't have that   they're going to pay for the wall   Hillary supports totally open borders   there goes your country and strongly   supports sanctuary cities like San   Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times a Trump   administration will end this nightmare   of violence and end it quickly we will   stop illegal immigration deport all   criminal aliens and dismantle every last   criminal gang in cartel threatening our   wonderful citizens we're going to   doing easily quickly   we will also repeal the obama-clinton   defense sequester and rebuild our badly   depleted military there haven't been   many times when we needed more I'm   honored to have the endorsement of more   than 200 top Admirals and Generals and   22 Medal of Honor recipients and that   list just grew a lot larger today   Hillary Clinton and our failed   establishment have dragged us into   foreign wars that have made us less safe   shift our wealth overseas to other   countries and left our borders at home   totally wide open that will change when   we win the presidency that will change   that will change   testitude it has to change from now on   it's going to be America first Baraka   Falls   and Justin summing up to all Americans I   say it is time for change it is time for   leadership just think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump administration we're going to have   the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan   and Hillary wants to raise your taxes we   will eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation we'll cancel   every illegal Obama executive order we   will protect religious liberty and   yesterday it was Billy Graham's 98th

[Music]   [Music]   [Music]   you   I   you   the   greatness of our country as the leader   of the free and unfree world has   vanished I've decided to do something   about it I couldn't stand to see what   was happening to our great country this   mask calls for leadership in the worst   way it needs someone with common sense   and business acumen someone who can   truly lead America back to what has made   us great in the past we need someone   with a proven track record in business   who understands greatness someone who   can rally us to the standard of   excellence we once epitomized I started   with the issue of illegal immigration   and proposed building a major wall that   would be very high and completely   impervious to the flood of immigrants   who we don't want or need here illegally   suddenly American started to wake up to   what was going on with regard to illegal   immigration despite the large number of   candidates who are running for the   Republican nomination what i was saying   started to really hit home with people i   started draw   very large crowd so that we   by raleys into football stadiums and   convention centers the first national   debate 224 million viewers which set a   record for cable television   all of a sudden people who had never   cared about the election were never   voted before   the rally's became massive the   were unbelievable the enthusiasm was   based on pure love and love of what we   were doing   the media the politicians and the   so-called leaders of our country reacted   in horror but I persevered and went   directly to the people because I don't   need anyone's financial support nor do I   need anyone's approval as to what to say   I just had to do the right thing I had   to do it I had no choice I see what's   happening to our country is going to   hell I had to   I've committed to a truly more powerful   military one prepared and equipped to   stand up to any and all of our foes when   we draw a line in the sand it needs to   mean something to all especially our   enemies   I released a tax plan that gives the   middle class   well rain comes   chance to keep more of what they earn   while restructuring how the richest   Americans   I've introduced a whole new approach to   job creation by encouraging companies to   bring more of their jobs and   manufacturing back to the United   along with the trillions of dollars   foreign banks overseas what we need is   leadership that can deal with our mess   and begin to apply practical   so much untapped greatness in our cut   together let's   make America great again I know people   have talked to you about whether or not   you want to run would you would you ever   I just probably wouldn't do it oh but i   probably wouldn't but i do get tired of   seeing what's happening with this   country and if I got so bad I would   never want to rule it out totally US   national debt currently stands at   eighteen point three trillion daughter   stopping the flood of fighters joining   Isis is much more   Oh   [Music]   I know thanks boy 3 well   [Applause]   a little bit different but you know you   lose a few jobs that's the problem one   the manufacturing is leaving stop   they're ripping us off like nobody has   ever ripped off the country don't worry   about an angan folks I'm looking at   these numbers you know before I leave   and honestly they're all pretty similar   the bridge one right I think maybe   you're a little bit worse bridgeport   region of Connecticut i always say give   me the stack so in bridgewater where are   you and you know as well that tremendous   victory   [Applause]   college boy impossible for me to get   over 50 don't forget fifty percent will   you have three people running the talk   and these characters in the media the   world's most is how most people they are   divorced I won South Carolina and one of   these things and you have these pundits   who are not that smart people and   they'll say and I had like 17 people   cope so at the beginning would have like   16 and 14 and 12 and I'd win and they   say Donald Trump did not get fifty   percent how do you get fifty percent   when you have all these people right and   even now we have three I call it too but   I really go and a half lions and cruises   at some   he's got no bears it's over because   statistically can't win anymore New York   you know it's nice when a place like New   York that knows we better than it at you   home right it's like if i lived in   bridgeport of somebody did a nasty story   the people that know me better than New   York people they bought it record   sixty-two percent almost   [Applause]   in all said well he has to get fifty   percent they thought they knew you   couldn't get because you have three   people running and but what was on the I   my Twitter I think 14 people and I did   very well i won what it says and I want   and then I hear the public who didn't   get over fit and a half senators and   governors and people like Ben Carson was   phenomenal by the way we did a really   smart guy and really smart people and   yeah 15 16 17 and then you win and they   say he didn't get thirty percent and   people don't think this evidence to bed   to hit I mean who can get it so now in   New York they didn't think rustling at   fifty percent we got almost sixty two   percent   [Applause]   elements 95 delegates we weren't almost   every delegate so I mean it was great so   what's happening is that not that proves   he has no pathway to victory other than   being a short seller is no pathway   different education has no he's he's 12   38 and he's running from this running   why you running I don't I'm just running   a lot of people a lot of people get   better than Jason and they said well   it's not fair you can't maybe Marco   Rubio people and first Christy get them   and a lot of it especially radiant or   Spears you know others and you know he's   going to keep down he's going to keep   running thank you I appreciate   [Applause]   I want to have no great job here a long   time ago and the great wish that they   said no better himself we would have

[Applause]   people could be out having fun watching   the baseball game playing golf playing   tennis Trump is   [Applause]   privately never have history arena go to   school and this is the same thing many   people have   [Applause]   we said you know I his people thought   about change   [Applause]   I   tired of steve jobs from overseas in the   other countries into Mexico they're   tired

their arm   you know the word I when I say a   beautiful such okay was that it may be   that he said yes dr. tom knows he's   really smart that he will you know be   different when he should privately which   of course we got everybody is when I'm   speaking who's that difficult when   you're regretting so he's different here   than he is gonna push to talk about a   policy stage in the form with

own   manager said that he talks his way and   then he said and he said he will know   more when building the wall cause I said   because of the words in concept is to   show you how disgusting politics the   concept is that because of the fact that   in a room uncle act different than when   I had thousands of people in front leg   like anybody else I'm saying essentially   the same thing I'm saying the same thing   what you say the different way so what   he did is talking shit he will change   and he won't get over the wall but he   won't do that everything I said   [Applause]   he actually used the expression like we   said it first with nobody was safe even   if we make it nobody would say okay oh   we didn't know because I made it totally   when I say here and it's always going to   be said that therefore it depends on   your or disoriented we have to be   different than we have 12 people sitting   in the conference room militia detectors   he speaks the same way I was

of people call it to number   one I want every single debate every   single source every single   [Applause]   do I course I can do this now for 10   months it's not like bowtique but i can   do it for how 9 i'm short temper but but   thank you don't I love you too baby so   and i love doing I've loved doing it   because it's going to be so much fun   first of all the people that I meet are   unbelievable people they love this   country so much saturday afternoon in a   little bit very warm complete power the   goodness is useful you speak I just   spoke in a room that was so hot it was   like a steam room it was like a steam   room you speak its exercise that it's   like you lose you lose ten matches that   what do I lost weight but we're going to   do such a good job did you have to   remember you remember this afternoon but   you have to remember or tuesday you have   to get up   you know very little to genetic and I'm   coming a lot together I don't take   anything we can't take anything for   granted I know the whole numbers running   go to forget the phone numbers because a   lot of times because they're all of   trumps cover when I love Trump   Easterwood when i run into though the   more we win by the better it's going to   be because we have a movement going on   it's being written about Bill O'Reilly   the other day but he said he biggest   political event to the effect that this   the Trump phenomenon and showing out the   Trump phenomena ditch you on the   phenomena believe out the nation set the   comfort of and now something to that   effect is the biggest political story   the most important political story of   his life   [Applause]   because I know and he's always brilliant   brilliant brilliant but but the truth is   and it's never an easy interview with   Bill I will tell you and he straight   down the middle he has no friendships no   nothing he goes right now that we've got   him and he said it he actually said it   twice because he said it the night   before to Bill O'Reilly but he said the   biggest political star in his lifetime   and he mentioned in that is the   assassination of John F Kennedy you know   which of course to be his big big and   horrible event and we've had some   horrible events in some very big events   so for him to say that it was a very big   steak and what he's saying please all   over when I go to Alabama we have 35,000   people walk perhaps a much bigger than   version by the way and Bernie's over but   Bernie they make a couple of statements   should i need to say because we're going   to forget about Bernie then are not a   monthly your sandwich burning what else   unless Hilary gets her diamond which his   birdie birdie birdie said that she's not   qualified to be present I thought big   thing and then he pulled it back a   little bit cuz that's a tough sell you   know why he said I'll tell you where he   is right and did I happy when what   Bernie said he said she suffers from bad   judgment GSF pitches she want to go into   the water right I was against it by the   way and burning recently but she wanted   to go into the war in iraq and i said   it's going to absolutely destabilize the   Middle East if you do that and it was a   disaster and I was right you know they   talked about jumping stuff jumps going   to have a fast trigger but I won't have   a fest I'm probably gonna have to slow   his trigger of anybody but nobody's   going to mess with me   [Applause]   ever ever before and look at a take care   of our vets who have been absolutely   [Applause]   Oh   thank you sir they do an unbelievable   job you know that one incident that was   a mistake or you had a problem for   someone at a millions of people and   they'll put that incident on television   for weeks and weeks siblings and our   police are amazing   so this all began in q4 june six days   before i came down to trump tower and I   saw warming them it look like the   Academy Awards I said all the time they   look like the Academy Award and is that   something I wanted to do as up then I   put this great company I have a nice   life have a wonderful family my family   [Applause]   but putting an errand luncheon and   Milania they're all involved and they   love it and they love it because they   know   [Applause]   now that is really for me it was about   dragons and was about boars and it was   general just so many things actively   trade is so easy it's not like right in   my wheelhouse because I know whether   it's rich board or Albany where I was   last week Sarah kids poughkeepsie   Bethpage Long Island Alderaan Suffolk   County all places i love right places i   mean i had as much as eighty seven and   eighty-nine percent you mention getting   89% to have an overwhelming victory like   that where it was far greater than even   they know it was far away from the   people that really know you the best   okay they know me they know the good   command the other day no comment I grew   up there and I've been in so much pain   person so much was written about me   something corrected some you know   dishonest but but the people of New York   really know me so to have that kind of a   victory this way and it really shows a   lot to Pennsylvania and Maryland at   Rhode Island and Delaware and yourselves   where I mean Connecticut obviously knows   we Pennsylvania knows because I went to   school there and I went to school that's   of a great place great state but they   all have the same problems and then we   have problems where jobs are they   participated six million jobs that can   take it out of our country like so   easily some reason and we apologize have   been working on this problem for five   years they don't know what to do and   what we're going to do let's say we have   a company or british north coast of   mexico will go enjoy bridgeport employed   because you bet you're coming back and   what happens is this ideally want to see   these   before they leave nobody talks I don't   think everybody talks so when companies   leave I don't think people talk to if I   were doing it I'd say here's what it is   but the governors are alternatives they   need help from the federal government   and we have to impose a major tax on   these companies when they leave they go   to Mexico like our air-conditioned if   they go to Mexico and they think they're   going to sell their conditions back into   our country notes you a free trade free   trailer I believe in it a hundred   percent but not when you have stupid   partner negotiated your deals so I'm not   return my three trade beads you know the   new look at Mexico there people are   shocked their leaders a shopper dis   smarter what they do they kill interest   of the border killing us overboard I   that won't happen now we even beyond the   wall e the control if you look at the   border patrol today gave us last week   you probably saw first time in the   history of the Border Patrol they 16,500   men and women endorsed Donald   [Applause]   sheriff joe arpaio he endorsed oh but   wouldn't have some work with what we   have to stop the drugs you know what I   want an action I go around will greet   people as my first Lakers I'm glove from   day one that this one and you see these   beautiful valleys and lakes the little   roads right into throat as beautiful but   people are incredible and I go into a   meeting and I say so what's the big   brother is a harrowing I say why don't   you just write it didn't it didn't mesh   with these beautiful trees that are your   heroine and then you go to other places   come here it's the same thing I mean I   know all about bridge would force okay   but you look it's coming in through the   South Dakota and I told the people   haven't you   [Applause]   stop Singapore is so tough on drug   dealers I mean this country I don't want   to have to tell you what are they doing   Singapore he said the hangar Singapore's   shut up for drug deals that people   wondering but see if word is so tough   and on a problem then I no problem   there's no games ok problem with us you   get caught once twice what like eight   times and then they start getting a   little bit tougher you can't sell   problems like that but I told the people   of New Hampshire then I tell South   Carolina went south carolina that wasn't   wants to be a stronghold protectors   which only one from meijer in his a liar   so i went with the evangelicals and i   wanted in the last row and I want   Louisiana and that's what I realized the   system's rigged because that one   Louisiana and I said oh I wasn't too   close to when we was him i was behind   and I was not supposed to win that was   supposed to be a ted cruz and remember   there are also other people there are   other people and again i'm doing with   some way and now i'm getting over fifty   percent with all these people now we   down to three final remember when they   say took those get over fifty percent i   was having 12 and 14 I want to spin karl   rove they assume   he was off like stuff and he was that   was he was trying to explain how the   fact that I wonder if you're part of the   greatest landslides anyone's ever seen   far right of that it wasn't really that   good it was an even the roses but even   he was like real in a hater the level of   hatred by the establishment of us is so   incredible it's so totally original   British a watch but what's these guys   and they were talking about the fifty   percent and he said again fifty percent   but this side and 61 or 62 percent you   can't say that anymore so he came up   with another narrative but when you   watch him struggling he's all nervous   and all crazy because this type of   insect was one of the biggest even   people that hate me said that was a   massive victory right and he's working   so hard to know what it doesn't read   that much you know I'm so ignored that   part and you see look folks the system's   rigged so what happens is Louisiana was   ticklish Ted Cruz was going to win the   South you know where all of a set   there's only one problem   [Applause]   I said before if I don't want to get   that it can i will read Alabama because   I'm telling the truth I 1 I 1 Alabama   one walking so we want places quit   Kentucky we won so many places Florida   was one of the greats were running a   shot right and I one messages or   something how about Massachusetts that's   pretty different okay but we have all   these victories and I said to people the   system I really found out about the rich   system elysium because I was behind I   wasn't supposed to live I was told over   and then a ball came out that over   several reports people I said hey let's   give it a shot so I went out there a   couple of times and the final line was a   Friday night and I made of speech and we   had an airplane hangar there was massive   like from Boeing 747 it was massive and   we said I'm coming to make your speech   the night before the election that   election took place i believe on a   saturday and i made a speech and the   people were unbelievable that it was   like a love dressed like this is it was   like a love   [Applause]   that's right involving a movement to the   comfort of time by the way they say it's   a movement like we've never had in the   history of our country it's true man   Charlie Lucia and I'm making this speech   and it was Emily and haha and the next   day they had the election and I one   reason i won again I wasn't supposed to   and he was supposed to when I was an   upset and I was it funny now a couple   weeks later they were editing up   different things that they're showing   how well with lurkers were winning a lot   of State said mostly muscle and then I   see let me show you better mistake I   said what no we didn't make a mistake   you made a mistake I want to stay easily   and you have this guy Chris having more   intelligence I want it I want Louise you   and they have cruise over here with what   that can't be possible how do you win it   and you don't get as the delegates go   I'll tell you it's a rig   so when i'm working with speeches he   can't win with the people we will get   decimated when they start doing negative   ads i had 55,000 negative ends cases has   had one when they sucked if they put one   ad on casing whatever it's going to be   point but you know what happens i say so   how does this happen and then all of a   sudden animal is heavily would go to   sell for like nine ten pond all of a   sudden i realize is a radio because how   can you want to stay and get blessed   elements right now so we started   focusing and watch out the delegates and   pennsylvania levels okay but it's still   a bad system because when you win with a   popular vote and when you win stakes by   a lot with the popular vote you win that   stay anyway so what this guy's guys who   can't win for the popular vote because   he's got zero personality because he   lies like a thing   people probably paid for by super PAC   which is not supposed to be happening go   overlap why do you dining people taking   it out to dinner spending a lot of money   probably getting the motel rooms and   everything else where do you see we'll   figure it all out but i'll tell you why   it's really buying an election in this   country and you can't do headphone so   you're not allowed to prevent into an   interesting to see is the super PAC   doing it okay you're not supposed to be   doing it at this total communication i   would say so we're dealing with a broken   system we're dealing with a crooked   system like crooked Hillary and we're   dealing and we're dealing really do it   with a fixed field and we're going to   change it now the only way to keep that   at this stage but the only way to beat   is like the fighter said you know the   boxes i love the process i've always   liked the boxes to roll the dice   endorsement I want to get coffee night   I was behind I love up enough but Rosie   didn't do I love that honestly I like   the toughest I like the guys that are   tough because just something about and   they like me and that's what you want   folks because you know what the world is   tough the world is not so if the world   is stuff when I'm done this country is   knocked out our leaders are tough our   negotiators our representatives of not   tough Secretariat's they terrorists   the ring we need we need toughness you   know when Jeb Bush is to say I don't   like this tone my tongue they are   chopping off people's heads in the   lilies they're drowning people at steel   cages and Jeff dosage I like dark rum   stop   I don't have

 [Applause]   [Music]   Oh   [Music]   he said to be a little while ago said   well that's not very positive message   it's actually a very positive because if   I didn't say that it would be this long   oh we have tremendous home we're going   to make our country so strong and so   here's me this has been a great effort   [Applause]   no   on Tuesday is so important here you know   with your friends and going ago and   that's when you look back and I said all   the time and I mean I will do such a   great job you will love you press them   but more proud   oh don't let me say that was the single   greatest vote I'm gonna yes go back 10   years from now and 30 years from now   you're gonna say the greatest vote I   never catch was that Tuesday I watch a   lot of time and then went to

welcome stars and president   [Music]   all over the place we live all over the   place   wow what a group   [Applause]   thank you   thank you   I love you we love Texas i love you i   love you texture   then   thank you wow   thank you everybody somebody asked me   how do you think you're going to do in   texas i think we're going to do very   well in texas   so I have to say this you know you have   to see what's going on outside there are   lines that are 22 miles long I don't   know and I'm not just saying this even   the press for the first time and they've   seen 35,000 crowds with me but I think   they're even impressed and to be honest   with you I mean which is coming in and   you took it about miles and miles of   people and i wish the fire department   and they're great they were wonderful   but they broke the all-time record for   this building by far and I see like you   can squeeze a couple of people from   outside but I guess you know that's the   fire marshals we have to go by our fire   marshals would anybody like to leave so   that some more people could come in I   don't   well I want to thank you this is a great   honor you think this is easy right you   think so I get up this morning I'm like   one of the early birds like a lot of you   people everybody's an early bird in this   group I think but I got up and I was in   Dallas and last night we made a speech   in Dallas and we had an amazing crowd   there to Gilley's we had a packed house   and we had thousands of people outside   that they actually thought were   protesters they weren't there were   people that couldn't get into the venue   thousands and then and then we went to   San Antonio and we raised oh we have   some San Antonio and we raised a lot of   money over the last two days for the   party the party is doing very well the   party is so the party is actually liking   me you know I'm an outsider I'm an   outsider and historically they don't   love the outsiders but I think they're   starting to like to be and maybe   there'll be a few you know you don't   hear about the tremendous numbers of   people and I'm even talking about the   politicians that are totally supportive   if one person raises a little question   it's like oh did you hear let me tell   you folks we have tremendous support   tremendous but the biggest support of   all by far right here I'm the messenger   right here right here   we have we have support like perhaps   nobody's ever had when they've run for   office certainly at this stage I don't   think anybody's ever seen anything like   this some of the pundits actually some   of the pundits that hate me they hate me   with a passion like which is great i bet   i love that oh i love that look at that   mexicans for Trump Mexicans the truck I   love it I love it   I love that thank you thank you that's   cool man and you know why it's Mexicans   to jump because I'm going to bring jobs   back into our country folks I'm going to   bring jobs back into our country and   Hilary doesn't have a clue she doesn't   know about jobs remember this remember   this her husband signed NAFTA true   maybe the worst economic development   transaction ever signed in the history   of our country it cleaned out our   manufacturing I mean I just won so many   states and I got to see these states I   went all over the different states in   Pennsylvania New York all over the place   and I got to see what NAFTA the havoc   that it wreaked and it's taking our jobs   just like we're a bunch of babies like   we're a bunch of babies and moved them   to other places honestly moved them all   over Mexico we have we have states with   it so you know I have statisticians   right the world's most boring job but   yeah we got to do it somebody's got to   do it and I get numbers where certain   states was fifty and sixty percent of   their manufacturing jobs and you'd go   upstate like upstate New York and you   see empty factories empty buildings   buildings that you could buy for nothing   buildings that have been abandoned where   they left because bill clinton signed   nafta and it didn't affect him so much   because he was gone but boy did it   affect the rest of these presidents let   me tell you and we're going to bring our   jobs back we're not going to be the   stupid people anymore folks we're not   going to be the stupid people so what we   have and we'll build the wall he says   build the one we're going to build the   wall we have to   we have to   look we have no choice we have no choice   so I just got three weeks ago I got the   endorsement of 16,500 Border Patrol   agents 16-5 it's the first time the   first time they've ever endorsed a   presidential candidate okay and they're   great people and by the way the job as   much easier now stand back don't talk   don't do the stand back much is your job   they want to do their job they see   what's happening to our country they   love our country they want to do the job   they're not allowed to do their job so   here's what's going to happen and I   asked them such incredible people I   asked him I said just you know I gotta   be a hundred percent sure do we need the   wall well you said yes but they said yes   also I don't know what I would have done   supposing they said no I'd say really   what am I going to do here but I said do   we need and they said mr. Trump it is   such an unbelievably important weapon   for drugs pouring through I mean we have   drugs pouring into our country when I   won New Hampshire I Love New Hampshire   my first victory you know we won 37 I   think i'm going to say i have to say i   think because if it's like 36 or 35 even   if it's 38 or 39 they'll correct me but   we won New Hampshire and when I say we   we really want it we want it this is all   about we this is about we   we I'll tell you folks I didn't have to   do this I didn't have to do this this is   uh I love it I love it I love it but I   didn't have to do dishes like work folks   this is hey you know what yesterday was   the one year anniversary what I   announced we're going to run yesterday I   was great the one year that was the one   year from yesterday somebody said you   know it's june sixteenth i said june   sixteenth that's when i decided to do   this and it's been a great experience   thank you darling these i'll tell you   what you know you see all Wow somebody   was protesting the safest place to be   anywhere is that a trump rally believe   me the safest way the safest place and   no matter what you say I mean you just   take a look now if there's one protester   that raises the handle though I love it   you know the only way I get the show cuz   nobody has crowds like we have and   they'll admit that not Bernie and birdie   did pretty well with the Krusty was   second by the way a deep deep second he   was way back now don't forget we agree   with Bernie on one thing trade he knows   how bad our trade deals are he gets it   he gets it and that's good now we're   trying to get Bernie's people because a   lot of those Bernie people hate Hillary   Clinton crooked Hillary as we call it   and of course Bernie hates Hillary   Clinton we know that that's for sure one   thing you got to say he doesn't give up   she's gone is he still here is he's   still here who would have thought that I   was going to win what eight weeks ago it   was supposed to be the opposite way and   here we have it from eight weeks ago and   she's still out there trying to say can   we get rid of bernie is there anyway and   just like she can't close that deal   folks she won't be able to make trade   deals she won't be able to take care of   our military everybody's going to be   ripping us off as a country okay the   same exact way and the same way that   you're looking at it so look is what we   have to do when I came down thank you   when I came down and I said I actually   said oh I thought it was a protester I   said friend or foe and it was friend   that I was disappointed because of its   friend the cameras will never go there   so that's not good thank you that's   called that's called an enthusiastic   friend but just so you understand we've   had things happen to our country I mean   World Trade Center if you look at what   happened in California recently san   bernardino you look at that it's a   radicalization like nobody's ever seen   before it's more it's a radicalization   it's a hatred it's a hatred it's a   deep-seated hatred and President Obama   is trying to make terrorism into guns   and it's not guns folks as it is not   guns   it is not guns this is terrorism and by   the way the NRA came out National Rifle   as I tell you what they came out very   strongly probably the earliest they've   ever done it so the National Rifle   Association endorsed Trump and those   people are fantastic people you know   they take a lot of heat they love this   country they love what it represents   they're protecting your second Amendment   and nobody will protect your second   Amendment like donald john trump nobody   nobody nobody   and remember this Hillary Clinton wants   to abolish the Second Amendment   essentially she wants to abolish the   Second Amendment she wants to take your   guns away and you see things like we saw   over the weekend remember this if you   had some of those incredible young   people that were so brutally killed over   the weekend or people in Paris where you   have the toughest gun laws in the world   in Paris and France in Paris you have   the toughest gun laws in the world   hundred and thirty killed wounded still   in the hospital devastated they'll never   be the same just horribly wounded same   thing in San Bernardino same thing in   our military base where we had five   unbelievable soldiers one of them was a   world-class marksman it was a gun-free   zone you know a gun-free zone often time   means carnage because let's call them   the enemy which is what they are and we   should declare war on Isis we should   declare war on Isis   war its war its war and they're   poisoning or they are poisoning our   youth through the internet they're   getting people to go over there the   press calls these people masterminds at   the top level they're not masterminds   folks they're thugs there's sick people   and we've got to put an end to it and if   we don't we're not going to have a   country left anymore we're not going to   have a country so so we're going to get   very tough our military is depleted   badly depleted you see that nobody   better than our military people nobody   better than our vets look at the way our   vets are being taken care we're going to   take care of our vets folks whose event   we're going to take care of our vets   they wait on line these are great people   our greatest people they wait on line   four five six and seven days and they   die they die waiting to see a doctor for   a routine ailment a routine ailment and   they're waiting five six seven days and   you see what's happening you see what's   happening it's like Hillary it's a   corrupt Enterprise okay it's a corrupt   enterprise and we're going to straighten   that out we're going to make sure they   get very quick and very good care and if   they can't see a doctor we're going to   have them go across the street to a   hospital to a private doctor to a public   hospital who cares and we're going to   pay the bill   we're going to pay that bill and you   know what that's less expensive by the   way that's less expensive than what   we're doing right now and you look at   the number of deaths so we're going to   take care very much so we're going to   take care of our veterans and that's and   I'm the one for the first time in   decades our veterans are going to be   treated like they should be treated   they're going to be treated great well   my friends my friends so I have in the   front row and I just see some of the   greatest people some of the greatest   people these are people who lost loved   ones either my friends these are my   friends and they called me right after   my announcement then they said thank you   mr. Trump nobody else has thought of   them these are people that lost loved   ones to people that should not have been   in the country and I want to just thank   you all your sweethearts thank you thank   you darling thank you thank you thank   you look at the sign hold that up look   at that sign wow whoa gays for Trump   gays   well look Hillary Clinton crooked   Hillary takes tens of millions of   dollars into our foundation foundation   takes tens of millions of dollars from   countries that kill gays and that   enslave women and i will tell you i am   far better for women i am far better for   gays   and now she wants people from these   countries to come into the United States   and I was saying at a five hundred   percent greater clip than Obama and the   press that I was wrong guess what it was   five hundred and fifty percent it was   more five hundred and fifty percent more   than Obama coming in and many of these   countries they want to kill gays and   they enslaved women and Hillary Clinton   wants a pouring in you tell me who's   better for gays who is better tell me   who is better for women who is better   for women   [Applause]   and what happened to the LGBT community   over the weekend to what happened there   and remember this remember this before   we get off to the next subject which is   going to be a very interesting subject   for you folks but don't we feel bad for   them 10 15 20 how many people are   outside press how many is it 10,000 or   20,000 because I'll tell you what I   think it's closer to 20 anyway anyway   anyway if we had if we had people where   the bullets were going in the opposite   direction right smack between the eyes   of this maniac   if some of those wonderful people had   guns strapped right here right to their   waist or write to their ankle and this   son of a bitch comes out and starts   shooting   and one of the people in that room   happened to have it and goes boom boom   you know what that would have been a   beautiful beautiful sight folks that   would have been a beautiful beautiful   sight   so don't let them take your guns away   and believe me you put me in there we're   going to save that second amendment   we're going to save your guns they're   not going to take away your bullets   they're not going to shorten up your   magazines they're not going to do   anything we're going to preserve it and   we're going to cherish it and that's   what we have to do   now remember this so we have I love you   look at this guy's keep shouting he   loves you love me right okay hey you   know what he's a guy but I love him okay   he's a guy but I love them that's cool   man all right so look we have a lot of   things happening one of the things is by   circumstance we lost a great Justice   Scalia and on the Supreme Court we're   going to have probably three pics but it   could be for it it could even be five it   could be a record in the history of the   Supreme Court for a four-year term add   if Hilary gets in there and puts these   horrendous pics in the Supreme Court   folks we are like Venezuela you see   what's happening to Venezuela right you   see what's happening we will be a large   scale version of Venezuela and it's not   going to be pretty one of the reasons i   hope you with me and I know every is   there anybody in this room that's not   going to vote for Trump just out of   curiosity nobody Wow USA USA   [Music]   amazing amazing okay so ready so one of   the most look defense is always the most   important right you know defense as   always but i will pick great smart   brilliant conservative intellects great   judges and what I've done is we went to   the federalist society where they really   and also with the auspices of heritage   which is a great group and we picked 11   judges we're going to probably put three   or four more on there but we picked 11   great great judges and I said from this   group or very similar to this group we   are going to pick judges for the United   States Supreme Court and you're going to   be proud of those judges and they're   going to be terrific hopefully very much   in the mold of judge Scalia that's what   we want to do okay so so I just think   it's so important the defense of our   country who have to build up our   military we have to take care of our   vets we have to do all these things but   we have to pick great justices for the   Supreme Court and if we don't we're not   going to have a country anymore we're   not going to have a country so it's so   important and a lot of people forget   they say oh well this isn't that so   important one of the most important   things okay so ready   [Applause]   [Music]   [Applause]   [Music]   but folks we have to have it and the   Border Patrol said mr. Trump you need it   look here's the story we need borders we   don't have borders right now we need   borders we either have a country or we   don't we don't have borders we don't   have a country all right and people are   pouring in and we need this but we also   need it for drugs when I was up in New   Hampshire I was going to say I spent   great deal of time there and I got to   know the people and it's a beautiful   state incredible the beautiful lakes and   rivers and roadways and the trees and   everything and I'd sit with a group and   say what's the big problem in New   Hampshire they said heroin I said heroin   it doesn't work I mean it doesn't fit   with everything the beauty and it turned   out to be a massive massive massive   problem for new hampshire and then i   went to south carolina i went to   massachusetts i went all over the place   no matter where i went heroin and drugs   at poor across the southern border and i   said to the people of New Hampshire my   first victory i love them i love them i   said to the people of New Hampshire look   if I get elected we're going to solve   you're probably going to try and get   your youth and it's not only youth   that's beyond youth but we're going to   try and get people help them we're going   to help them we got to make them better   we got to get them off it it's not easy   we're going to work like hell to get   them off this horrible stuff that's   flowing in and it's cheaper than candy   it's cheaper than candy because there's   so much of it it pours in because our   leadership our president doesn't have a   damn clue what the hell he's doing   and our youth are being poisoned they're   being poisoned and the war will be done   and you know interestingly when I was   talking to certain politicians they said   you don't really fill the wall I mean   you can't really build a wall well we   have two thousand miles we actually need   1,000 even less than that because we   have a lot of natural barriers right big   strong wonderful natural barriers so we   need a thousand miles the Great Wall of   China is 13,000 miles long and it was   built 2,000 years ago folks 2,000 years   ago and they didn't have caterpillar   tractors just so you understand you know   to the best of my knowledge they didn't   have and we will not use komatsu we will   use caterpillar ok we will use that not   easy come on you know I used to tell the   story and I could see what was happening   I don't know if you saw two days ago was   announced that our trade deficit our   trade deficit is the largest that's been   in seven years okay now think of that   house it and Here I am four years saying   our trade or trade our trade and the   arrogance they don't listen they don't   listen to me they have to listen to me   right because I'm representing a lot of   people folks so we have the largest   trade deficit we've had in many many   years and I'm that's why I mentioned the   name komatsu right and a friend of mine   this is two years ago now I used to tell   this to I haven't told it but he's an   excavator a great excavator big and I   see him and he's very sad and I say why   you sad he's a rough guy doesn't get too   sad but he gets sad is rough most   excavators are pretty rough right you   know these are not these are not babies   but let's say this he's a sad as an   excavator can be right but he said to me   Donald I just ordered komatsu he said   really why he said because chip   pam has devalued their currency to such   an extent and he always bought   caterpillar tractors his whole life he   bought caterpillar and they couldn't   compete only for one reason because   Japan has brilliantly devalued devalued   devalued and he went on made a very very   large order of komatsu I say are they as   good he said no but they're very good   they're very good high quality equipment   not as good but good enough and quite   good and I said so what do you think he   said our country's in trouble and I   started telling this story two years ago   and if you think about it I really   predicted exactly what was going to   happen because look at what's going on   we're losing our jobs like crazy the   reason I want Indiana was largely well   was because of Bobby Knight I mean Bobby   Knight you know Bobby Knight and some   other great folks I want to tell you and   I think we would have one very big   anyway but boy did we win in a big   landslide but you know what that was   right in the time when everybody was   talking about carrier air conditioner   moving to Mexico firing 1,400 people and   those people were following me around   that week in Indiana they came from   Indianapolis and Kerry had a big plant   and they said we're closing at folks who   remember his own all over television   we're closing it we're moving to Mexico   now I don't blame Mexico I don't blame   Mexico and I don't blame China for   ripping us off and they are ripping us   big league right biggest trade deficits   in the history of the world with China   we have rebuilt China I don't hold it   against them at all not all I don't hold   it against China I don't hold it against   Japan I don't hold it against Mexico or   Vietnam or India or any other country   that's killing us on trade that's taking   our jobs I don't hold it against them I   hold it against our leaders for being   grossly incompetent   incompetent and when they want to take   our companies out of our country there   is going to be a price to be paid   there's going to be consequences no more   folks no more no more no more empty   factories that sit there and rot like   all over Pennsylvania all over New York   State all over Maryland I'm looking at   these places you wouldn't believe what   you're seeing and you could see 20 25   years ago thriving thriving enterprises   and now they're rotted from the water   and from the wind so we're going to do   things folks and we're going to be the   smart people again you know a lot of the   Republicans have said to me and they   said you know you are not conservative   and the reason i imitate somebody said   you are not a conservative because you   don't believe in free trade okay who   cares let me tell you fuck number one   I'm a Republican number two I happen to   be I happen to be conservative but but   more importantly I was asked by one of   the networks recently so what is your   status you know to be a conservative   you're supposed to believe in free trade   goes across the border but we don't have   free-trade people think we do because   there's stupid people we don't have free   trade with China with China they dump   their product all over the place they're   dumping steals and ruining our steel   mills they're ruining our steel mills   Obama is closing up our coal miners in   our minds so you got you got miners all   over the place and you know what I went   into West Virginia we won West Virginia   in a landslide because the miners know   that I'm going to put the miners back to   work we're going to put the steel   workers back to work   we had to put them back to work and   we're going to put them back fast but I   don't blame these countries what I do is   I blame our inadequate leadership and   it's almost hard to believe that this   could be happening when you look at   what's going on with our country now   here's what we're going to do let's take   the clay and I could talk about Ford I   can talk about terrier I can talk about   hundreds of different companies that are   no longer here then no longer here and   here's the story folks I believe in free   trade okay that's official but here's   the problem with free trade we need   smart leaders to make free trade work   and we have leaders that are not smart   in fact they're rather stupid I must say   they're rather slipper so I was asked in   a program the other day recently they   said do you believe in free trade I said   yeah I do do you believe in fair trade   yeah I do I believe in Trey well what   kind of trade do you like the best i   said here's my trade I want to make   great deals that's what it is for the   people for this cuz I don't care if it's   free Trey I don't care if it's fair it   doesn't make any difference I want my   trade deal I want to make good deals for   you and I have the greatest negotiators   in the world we have Carl Icahn I've   gotten endorsed by the big business   leaders they love Trump what can I tell   you but I have such great endorsement I   have we have the greatest negotiators in   the world in our country and we don't   use them to make these deals that are   bigger than any companies deals these   are the biggest deals deals with China   deals with Japan and Mexico these are   the biggest deals in the world folks and   we use political lightweights political   hacks that don't know what they're doing   and China looks at us and they can't   believe how stupid we are they can't   believe they get away with it for years   it's amazing that the country not so   well but that the country functions it's   amazing so we're going to change all of   that and when we came down remember when   I saw to this journey when I started   this journey it was about illegal   immigration and these are my friends   right here and they've lost big league   big league the biggest they've lost the   biggest all of my friends unbelievable   people they've lost the biggest but when   I came down it was about illegal   immigration and it was about trade and   it was about a strong military but   basically it was about illegal   immigration and trade and bringing her   jobs back then we had Paris happen and   we had other things happen whether it's   in Bernardino or so many others and I   started saying well we got to toughen up   this country we have to be very very   smart and very strong and very vigilant   and we have to get people when they see   there are bombs all over the floor of an   apartment they have to report these   people to the authorities and they have   to report them fast they have to report   them fast no more games you know the   leader of the Paris attack they couldn't   find him do you remember and it was   almost a year you know where he lived   right next to where he was living for   years everybody knew he was there nobody   reported him they found him through luck   nobody reported him San Bernardino they   see all these bombs all over the floor   they say well well you know not to   normal that bombs all over your   apartment floor right people saw it this   maniac over the weekend look at his   record people saw what he was doing   first of all his wife knew I think his   father knew I think a lot of people knew   and they didn't report him and we have   now 50 young people we have 50 people   dead we have a tremendous number of   people badly horribly gray   Lee injured they didn't report him they   knew he was going to go they knew he was   going to explode nobody reported him   nobody they have to report and I've been   saying it for two weeks big league and   now all of a sudden people are saying   report they're saying report okay so   here's one other thing folks we have a   country that's bust right we have a   country that's but we protect Japan we   protect Germany we protect Saudi Arabia   we protect South Korea we protect all   these countries and they don't pay us   what it costs they don't pay us we're   losing a fortune we have to go to those   countries which are wonderful countries   we have to say we need help now Hillary   said how dare Donald Trump say that he   wants to abandon Japan I don't want to   abandon Japan now here's the problem   with what she said by her saying that   you can never make a good deal because   she's saying under no circumstances   folks we have to be prepared to walk I   don't want to walk hopefully we're not   going to walk but if you don't say   you're going to walk or if you're not   prepared to work you're never going to   get them to pay we are losing billions   and billions and billions of dollars   protecting very strong financial   behemoth South Korea how about Saudi   Arabia Saudi Arabia was making 1 billion   dollars a day when the oil was I now   they're still making a fortune if we   weren't there Saudi Arabia wouldn't be   there for two weeks okay we protect   Saudi Arabia we pay rent we pay rent on   facilities that we have we pay rent and   we're protecting with Japan with our   Japan treaty if the United States gets   attacked they can watch the attack on   Sony television and never do a thing if   they get attack we have to use the full   force of our armed forces to protect   them okay who make   these deals who makes these deals who   makes these deals so what I'm saying is   this I have to go my favorite so I get   asked by a very good commentator what do   you think of NATO now in all fairness   i've been doing deals on my life I do   you know I built this great company and   all that stuff and I do deals nobody   talked about NATO I mean in all fairness   i'd like to say i have great experience   with NATO but I do have a lot of common   sense and I do have a lot of business   instinct like some of my friends are   here so the question is why do you think   of NATO sending myself first thing is   nobody's ever asked me this before   second thing is well I said this I said   number one I believe it's obsolete you   know set up many many years ago about   the Soviet Union Soviet Union doesn't   exist now it's Russia but Russia is   still a big threat it's okay for Russia   the problem is the problem is that our   new threat of terrorism and NATO wasn't   really set up for terrorism they don't   even have the right countries all right   so i said it's obsolete because it   doesn't take care and take into account   terrorism number two all of these   countries well a lot of them don't pay   you know in the real estate business I   have some friends that are in real   estate here they call it their   delinquents right that delinquent they   didn't pay their rent these people   didn't pay now we're protecting them   probably end up in third world war by   protecting these countries they don't   even pay or they pay us a fraction or   they pay us much less than they've   agreed to pay us because nobody asks   them for money in the meantime we have   the highest taxes in the world we have   budget deficits that are through the   roof and by the way speaking of that i'm   lowering your taxes lower than any other   candidate by far   by far and we're getting rid of these   horrible horrible regulations that are   killing people and killing small   businesses were getting rid of so many   of them so many so I said so I said it's   obsolete they don't take care of   terrorism and they're not paying up they   got to pay up and it turned out I was   right on both counts but I'll never   forget the first three or four days   Donald Trump didn't know anything about   NATO I said why three or four days later   all of a sudden people that studied it   very closely that never study anything   else I like to have blinders on right   they can't see the forest for the trees   right you know the expression they can't   see the forest for the trees all of a   sudden three or four days later people   are saying he's brilliant he's great   he's sprint like Putin Putin called me   brilliant I like it they want me to   disavow Putin said Donald Trump is   brilliant essentially he'll be the next   leader but Donald Trump is brilliant and   the people I was debating against they   said we would like you to disavow that   safe and I said you think I'm going to   disavow that statement are you crazy so   with nature so I went three day and the   press was just absolutely brutal like I   didn't know what the hell I'm talking   about give me a break then three or four   days later the experts are sergeant say   you know huh trumpets all right it's   obsolete these are people that study it   eight hours a day they studying and they   say you know Trump could be right and   he's right also they're not paying up   they're not paying up they always a lot   of money many of these countries okay   now here's what happens about seven days   ago front page of The Wall Street   Journal big big story NATO to set up   major terrorism unit general so-and-so   to be the head of it   I said that's what I said now they don't   give me credit for that you know they   had a little sentence like a little one   third sentence Donald Trump wasn't happy   about all correct right folks our   country has such incredible potential we   have such incredible   there are so many pockets of fat there   are so many pockets of stupidity we can   bring our country back bigger and better   and stronger than ever before i'm   telling just on the military and i said   this i said again you have to always be   prepared to walk but just in the   military i said look we want to help   japan we want to be a great Ally to   Japan we'll always be friends with Japan   but you know they got to help us they   sent Obama sent a general out and he   said doesn't Donald Trump know this is   true I promise doesn't Donald Trump know   that Japan covers fifty percent of the   cost of the military I said why don't   they cover a hundred percent of the cost   of the why why why now you know if he   said 50 present the number is probably   25 or twenty percent okay folks will   like the country and so true that's   being led by the dumb people it's not   going to happen anymore folks it's   America first to America for some   America   and we're going to get it going and   we're going to get it going like it   hasn't been going in many many years I   really made it you know my theme I see   all these hats make America great again   white red camo black all of these hats   but we're going to you know the theme is   make America great again I honestly   believe it will be make America great   again make America safe again safe and I   really believe I really really believe   that our country can be greater than   ever before I know the people these are   unbelievable you these are unbelievable   people and folks we don't win anymore   right we don't win anymore we don't win   we don't win with anything we don't win   on trade we don't win with the military   we're going to knock the hell out of   Isis by the way we have

  thank you   [Music]   great people Granna before   in three days we are going to win the   great state of Colorado   and we are going to win back the White   House gonna happen   so important if you haven't mailed in   your ballot don't do that bring it bring   it take it to the drop box in your   County don't put it in the mail I know   everybody says how honest everything is   with our political system but we all   know better go in person to your local   polling center and drop it in and make   sure you get it dropped in otherwise   they'll say gee whiz it got there 14   minutes late and they won't count it so   we're really late enough that hopefully   you can bring it hop in the car and   we'll all appreciate it because we are   going to make America great again   as I've traveled this nation I've met   the most amazing people their hopes have   become my hopes their dreams have become   my dreams I've shared their joy and I've   also seen their heartache I've seen so   much heartache I've met with grieving   mothers who lost their children families   who've lost their hope and so many   people who've lost their faith in the   future and the future of our country our   [Applause]   government has failed our citizens but   we are going to turn it all around and   deliver the change and leadership that   America deserves we're going to turn it   around   this is a movement like our country has   never seen before it's a movement that's   powered by our love for each other and   our love for our country we're living in   a very divided country but it's not   gonna be divided for long we're gonna   get along we're all gonna get along   the special interests who used to   getting their way have been trying   everything possible to stop us you know   and the media are among the most   dishonest people anywhere at any time   but they can't stop us because we're on   the side and it's the great side of the   American people that's what it is real   change begins with immediately   immediately repealing and replacing   Obamacare   it's just been announced that the   residents of Colorado where by the way   we're doing extremely well you do man to   getting a little worried I know Hilary   all of a sudden she's making all of   these strips she's going all over the   place she was supposed to be home   sleeping this is not good for me she's   going to North Carolina they're worried   I think she's coming back here I know   she's going to Michigan she's going to   Michigan   see Michigan was never really in play   for a Republican but you know what it's   in play for us because all of their cars   are being made now in Mexico the cars   are being made in Mexico it's in play   now I think her going to Michigan's not   going to help us because she was there   while Mexico and other countries took   the businesses right out of their midst   rip the jobs right out of him now no no   I think she's wasting her time I think   rather than going to Michigan sheer to   go home and relax that's what I think   you   well here's the bad news the residents   of Colorado are going to experience one   of the most massive double-digit premium   hikes you've ever seen in your life or   Obamacare   [Music]   but it's not gonna matter because we're   gonna terminate it anyway so don't worry   about don't worry about we'll get rid of   it fast it's falling of its own weight   in the great state as an example of   Arizona where we're doing wonderfully   also premiums are going up more than one   hundred and sixteen percent great people   very unfair ninety percent of the   counties in Colorado are losing   Obamacare insurers next year ninety   percent good luck with your negotiation   folks but again you're not gonna have to   worry about it get those ballots in get   him in get him   premiums are certain companies are   leaving insurer fling doctors are   quitting and deductibles are going   through the roof some are 15,000 16,000   dollar deductible in other words you   don't even have health care yet Hillary   Clinton wants to double down on   Obamacare making it even more expensive   she's also raising your taxes very   substantially from big big taxi I'm   asking for your vote so we can repeal   and replace Obamacare and save health   care for every family in Colorado and in   our country   real change means restoring honesty to   our government will start by getting   Clinton out of the way better stuff got   to start something there's little doubt   that FBI director Comey and the great   special agents of the FBI will be able   to collect more than enough evidence to   garner indictments against Hillary   Clinton and your inner circle   despite her efforts to disparage and   discredit the FBI if she were to win it   would create an unprecedented   constitutional crisis be unprecedent   there'd be nothing like it would be a   disaster from day one it would be a   disaster look at the way she's handled   the email musze all she had to do is use   the server they gave her assume   everybody was watching assume that the   world was watching look what the hell   she's done this is the way she'll run   the country in that situation we could   very well have a sitting president under   a felony indictment and ultimately a   criminal trial we need a government that   can work properly from day one for the   American people we are so far behind we   are so far behind   so many things to do that will be   impossible with crooked Hillary Clinton   the prime suspect in a far-reaching   criminal investigation it's impossible   her current scandals and controversies   will continue throughout our presidency   and we will make it honestly look it's   going to be virtually impossible for her   to govern now the Republicans have   talked very tough and the Democrats it's   going to be just another mess for   another four years folks a mess we've   got to get back to work right i mean we   have to get back to get this country   straight now hey we do 0 20 trillion you   know it's like we got to start someplace   if she ever got into the Oval Office   Hillary under special interests would   rob this country blind   [Applause]   [Music]   at the heart of this election is a   simple question will our country be   governed by the people or by the corrupt   political class if we win the corrupt   politicians and their special interests   lose if they win the American people   lose it's just that simple and I must   tell you folks it's not that this is   easy don't forget now let's see New York   time fish is now one o'clock in the   morning   this is like what my fourth or fifth the   one it's one in the morning but but I   love doing it because I see with coming   three days so many great things look I   was on the other side I love this   country I saw what was happening I was a   total insider boy did I become an   outsider quickly right jun 16   we have a certain Center I'd never told   us never told us we have a certain   senator he would be so nice to me for   years Don how are you this is Senator   so-and-so I'd love to see you and talk   to you and sight see him had come up i'm   always given tremendous amounts of money   to the senator for some committee to   reelect senators and ba Baba we have and   we're gonna this and wicked I said to my   favorite Center do me a favor I'm really   busy just how much well if you could   contribute excess it was always like you   know a lot of money the same I didn't   want to waste a lot of time because they   talked forever so this guy was always   very nice and every year for years I   give him a lot of money for his   committee and that was it okay I didn't   care then I announced on june sixteenth   of last year Donald Trump running for   president   this senator like it was called Trump   ooh I don't I don't know him I don't   know him no no I went from a great   insider and it was very nice I mean I   liked it it's great I was building this   big company i built i built a truly   great company but i went from really   some of the great assets of work some of   the great real estate assets of the   world that's all right very little debt   tremendous company and I'm proud of it   and I love doing it but I would see   what's going on i watch these   politicians give a hundred and fifty   billion dollars back to Iran number one   terrorist I watched our military more   and more the depletion of our Miller we   have the greatest people but our   military's depleted i watch all the   things that i watch our veterans being   treated so badly any veterans in there I   mean we're treating illegal immigrants   people that come into our country   illegally we're treating them far better   in many cases that we treat our veterans   [Music]   I watched all the things that are going   on I watched four hundred million   dollars in cash supposedly go to a rent   cash that means you could fill this   whole section of this arena with us up   except it wasn't 400 million and that   was to pay for the hostages except obama   lied just like he lied about obamacare   you know you can keep your plan you gave   you a doctor but he said it wasn't it   wasn't for the hostages but it was 400   million I said men 400 do you get to see   a million dollars in cash it's like   massive 400 million occasion except it   wasn't 400 turned out to be one point   seven billion aeroplane full the   airplanes I mean for think of it 400 but   it wasn't it was 1.7 minute anyway I   look at the way things run so sad and   some things happened after I ran but   it's all the same the incompetents the   gross and competence I look at the 10   sailors they're off course a little bit   we just made a deal the way they   humiliated those sailors and humiliated   our country so many things so many   things and I said I love our country so   I went from an insider to the ultimate   outsider and I must tell you I love   and it's all about making America great   again making our country whether if you   want a government that will secure your   borders stop the massive inflow of   refugees lower your taxes bring back   your jobs grow your economy and protect   your family I think you have to vote for   Donald J Trump   I was watching tonight coming over in   the plane Lou Dobbs I gotta tell you   what a fantastic guy fantastic he gets   it he gets it and he said such nice here   he said Donald Trump started early in   the morning he was in Florida he was   here he went to North Carolina he went   he's been all over the country said he's   got more energy but you got to have   energy to fix our country you need   energy you ever see the energy hey you   want to see energy take a look at the   energy of the Chinese leaders okay you   want to see energy take a look at the   energy of all of these leaders of   countries that are just beating us just   meaningless he also said I'm one of the   great political speakers of all time I   said what a nicely nobody says that   nobody sees   these guys have never said that the   dishonest media no Lou Dobbs is just a   great guy have to say because I've   watched him for a long time and I've   benefit and you know what you have to   reward people that are just good they're   good they have no axe to grind you know   what his axe to grind is he wants to see   the country be great that's what is that   so that's enough awesome but he's a   great guy my contract with the American   voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption and to take our   country back from special interests and   donors I want the entire corrupt   Washington establishment to hear the   words that we not me we are about to say   when we win on november eighth we are   going to drain the swamp   raised   when I heard that statement I said no I   don't like that I don't like it it's so   hokey I told you once I said look two   and a half weeks ago probably I said it   once to a big audience and I said so   hokey uh-huh I said drain the swamp they   went crazy then the second time they   went crazy then I started feeling a   little more confident in using that they   were going one now they're all going   crazy and now I love the statement I   think it's genius   [Applause]   thank you at the core of my contract is   my plan to bring back our jobs terrible   what's happened it is so terrible what's   happened America has lost one third of   its manufacturing job since NAFTA a deal   signed by Bill Clinton and supported by   Hillary Clinton America has lost seventy   thousand factories since China entered   the World Trade Organization another   bill and hillary backed disaster we're   living through the greatest jobs theft   in the history of the world leggett and   platt your neighbors laid off 326   workers in Thornton and move their jobs   to China   optima batteries laid off 276 workers in   aurora and move their jobs to china   carefusion resources later off 159 work   is a soul recent in inglewood and move   their jobs to Mexico we're like a one   lane highway out of the country the cash   goes out the jobs go out the factories   go out plants go out we get drugs and we   get unemployment that's what we get   because our politicians are stupid   people they're stupid people this stupid   a jump administration will stop the jobs   from leaving America and we will stop   the jobs from leaving Colorado you're   losing a lot   the theft of American prosperity will   end a trump administration will   renegotiate NAFTA and if we don't get   the deal we want we will terminate NAFTA   and getting much better deal for our   workers one of the great disasters of   all time now we will also immediately   stop the job-killing trans-pacific   partnership that Hillary Clinton said is   the gold standard and then she lied in   the debate right and she said she never   said it but turned out she said and it   is the gold standard for the countries   that are opposed to us their goals that   the gold standard for them not for us as   part of our plan to bring back jobs we   are going to lower taxes on American   business from thirty five percent to 15   and very importantly for Colorado we   will unleash the power of American   energy including shale energy and clean   call right here in your state and we're   going to put your miners back to work   and we're gonna put your steel workers   back to work   and we will rebuild our inner cities we   will rebuild our inner cities the   african-american community the Latino   communities are hurt very badly they   hurt very badly it's been very unfair   for almost a hundred years unbroken   Democrats have ruled the inner cities   and they just do one thing every four   years they come they say please please   give us your vote will help you you give   them the vote and they say see you in   four years they don't do a thing they're   dangerous the education stinks and   there's no jobs and it's at a point   probably as bad as it's ever been as bad   as it's ever been so I say to you and I   mean this sincerely what do you have to   lose what do you have to lose to the   african-american community to the Latino   Hispanic community what do you have to   lose and by the way the votes are coming   in all over the place and we are doing   very well with the african-american   community and we are doing very well   with the Hispanic community we are doing   very well everyone's saying what's going   on because they get it they're smart   they get it they get it they're tired of   being ripped off they get it so we're   doing very well you saw that votes away   way down there's no enthusiasm from   Hillary why would anybody be enthused   includes now we do have enthusiasm we   have record breaking enthusiasm   according to the we have record   record-breaking we have enthusiasm like   probably they've never seen before sort   of interesting when these great states   were coming in so many successes today I   was watching one and we're doing very   well in New Hampshire and it was passed   on to this anchor and they passed it on   about Trump Anderson no oh this is the   response Oh Holly he's doing very well   in new hamp let me tell you these people   are rigged they're part of the rigged   system the media is almost the biggest   part of the Rings   we will become a rich nation again but   to be a rich nation we must also be a   safe nation Hillary Clinton wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees pouring into our country   [Applause]   her plan will import generations of   terrorism extremism and radicalism into   your schools and throughout your   communities when I'm elected president   first of all I'm representing you people   I'm here to represent me we will suspend   the Syrian refugee program and we will   keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell   out of our country   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and yes we will build a great   wall right there for that guy   and Mexico as you know which is making a   tremendous fortune on trade with our   country on the border on trade on   everything every country does by the way   every country does who doesn't if you   can't make money with the United States   you shouldn't be representing your   country everybody does but Mexico we   have a tremendous trade deficit with   mexico i met with the president three   months ago terrific guy we're gonna make   we're gonna have a great relationship   with China with Mexico with Japan with   everybody but folks it's got to be a   double street it's got to be a two-way   street right now it's just everything   goes to other countries we get nothing   anytime take a look at Japan Japan sends   those cars by the hundreds of thousands   we send them practically nothing you   call that trade imbalance goes on for   years nobody does anything about we send   them wheat wheat it's wonderful to send   weed but they sent us cars by the   hundreds of thousands so many different   things so many different things that we   can fix so easy you know we have the   greatest business people in the world   have so many people endorse a me Carl   Icahn great these are great natural   natural negotiators we don't use them we   use political hacks to make deals with   China and then we lose almost 500   billion dollars a year with China and we   want to know what's wrong with us what's   wrong what's wrong with us is we have   people that don't know what they're   doing making deals with some of the   smartest people in the world they use   their smartest toughest meanest people   we use dumb people we use hacks   I've done a lot of business with China I   think John is great I've done great I've   made a lot of money with China I have   their bank the biggest bank of the world   from China's my tenant I sell condos I   the bank america building in San   Francisco another big building in   Manhattan that I got through China I   mean John is great but I don't hold it   against China I hold it against the   stupidity of our leadership to allow   China to get away with us   and then on top of it all to show the   lack of respect they have for our   country they go into the South China Sea   and they're building one of the great   fortresses of the world for landing   aeroplanes for docking their ships the   military ships and yet they're making a   fortune with us they take our money they   take our jobs think of this they take   our money they take our jobs and we owe   them one point six trillion dollars it's   like how does that happen it's magic you   know what you call that magic for them   not for us as Secretary of State Hillary   Clinton allowed thousands of the most   dangerous and violent criminal aliens to   go free because their home countries   would not take them back because they   were smart they don't want killers back   they don't want drug lords back they   don't want gang members back they said   get him the hell out of here we're not   taking her back so we turn around the   plane or whatever the hell we bring them   in they call up the State Department   Hillary Clinton says oh we don't want to   make waves let me tell folks there won't   be one time when we're bringing somebody   back that we come back with that person   sitting in that airplane I can tell   [Music]   and these various countries will   understand that but nobody's told them   that so they just don't understand it   but they will and we'll have a good   relationship with them Hillary supports   totally open borders there goes our   country and by the way we will build   that wall skip job   this young Patriot keep shouting build   the wall build the wall but finally I   said okay I'll get a bill we're gonna   build the wall who's gonna pay for the   wall hundred fish 150 mile away and the   reason some of the politicians during   the debates you know I went we had 17   now we have I have one left one one one   left one left before we make this   country great again one left crooked   Hillary worn one we have three days left   now I guess it's sort of like two days   two and a half days but we're gonna   we're gonna do it it's gonna be so good   you're going to be so proud of your   country again I'm telling you you're   gonna be so free   look at the spirit in this room and you   know what I don't need Beyonce and I   don't need Jay Z I like   I don't need I don't need jello and I   don't need Jon Bon Jovi nice guy they're   all nice they're all nice but I don't   need them we have far more people than   her you heard what happened last night   with Beyonce and with jay-z first of all   she said about me his language is nude   to his language my language is nothing   compared to what jay-z was doing last   night and Beyonce nothing   my language is like maybe tuck listen   what jay-z said last night that's a   different category and then Beyonce what   she said and then Hillary walks on and   kisses and hugs and kisses it up it's   okay how come I'm lewd I'm lewd but   they're fine you know now here's what   happened last night let me tell you the   facts Hillary cannot draw people she's a   very uninspiring person this country   needs somebody that's going to inspire   with this country aside from many things   else we need a cheerleader to bring   people together right she's gone she's   down to chill   but here's what happened and the crooked   media doesn't tell you this so she can't   draw people they won't show this crowd   they're not going to show they'll see a   couple of heads up here they'll see your   nice beautiful white head of beautiful   hair you'll see these folks here as few   old Trump digs gold that's true i do   dick hard but they'll see these folks   but i'll tell you what happened so they   do the concert they didn't even have a   big group for beyonce and for jay-z was   it big nothing like what I had in   Hershey Pennsylvania or what we have   look at every arena is back you know we   have thousands of people outside but   here's the thing and I don't have a   guitar and I don't have a piano but what   happens is they start the concert the   language was filthy it was it was filthy   by any standard of anybody in this room   and people started to leave and then   when the concert was almost over a lot   of people had left and then when they   were finished everybody left and she   stood up and talked and there was nobody   there practice sure cuz nobody's going   to see her   but the dishonest media doesn't say that   I thought she has a wonderful crowd that   a wonderful crap did that because   beyonce is there there there because J   Lo and because John banjo and we give me   a break folks and you know there's   something and somebody said it tonight   that's a very smart political person   that I respect when you have to have all   of these different people to get   involved politically they don't tear   they really don't care they use the word   that was interesting it's demeaning to   the political process it really is think   of it it's demeaning to the political   process so they fill it up but they   didn't even fill it out but they bring a   lot of people they do the concert a lot   of people were offended by how bad the   language was and a lot of people left   but by the time hillary got on most of   the people had left and the press   doesn't write that they don't write that   so they give you a false impression of   what's going on with us people are here   people love what we're saying people   love what we say   [Applause]   so Hillary supports totally sanctuary   cities like San Francisco where Kate   Steinle was murdered by the illegal   immigrant who was deported at least five   times thousands of Americans would be   alive today if not for the open border   policies of Obama and Clinton here in   Colorado detective Donna young you know   the story and detective John Bishop were   providing security at a baptism when   they were ambushed by an illegal   immigrant who had multiple prior run-ins   with law enforcement and who the people   that knew him begged for his   incarceration the illegal immigrant shot   and killed detective young and badly   wounded detective bishop the perpetrator   was a gang member and should have never   ever been allowed in our country by the   way there are hundreds of thousands of   these doors also here in Colorado   Patricia gun throw and Deborah's erect   along with a small toddler were killed   by an illegal immigrant who had been   arrested 16 times by seven different   police departments throughout the great   state of Colorado and nothing huh   and people that knew him also said   please please he's dangerous please   incarcerated but our state Department   and the people involved didn't want to   get involved in that so people lie dead   a trump administration will end this   nightmare of violence and end it quickly   we will stop illegal immigration deport   all criminal aliens and dismantle every   last criminal gang in cartel threatening   our great services and I have to tell   you you see the numbers coming in and   we're getting great poll numbers with   the Latinos great and we're getting   great poll numbers people are surprised   because we have so many people there   here legally they have a great job they   have a great house they want to keep   their job they want to keep the house   and and they love what I'm saying they   agree with me the Cuban Americans they   just gave me the bigger with the pay of   the ebayer pig award and it was a big   thing in Miami two days ago from the   Cuban Americans because of what I've   done and because of my attitude toward   castro you know it said 2 etcetera but   we're doing very well people are   surprised but they shouldn't be   surprised a radio owner in New York who   has an all-spanish radio station Colin   he said you know I don't know everyone   talks about Trump but all of my callers   love them and they're all Hispanic   they're all Latino and I just want to   tell you I do talk about building a wall   because we have to keep the drugs out   from poisoning our children   yeah but you know I always also or I   like to at least it because I do so much   ad libbing as opposed to everybody else   but I do like to mention whenever   possible that in that wall we're going   to have big beautiful doors and people   are going to come pouring through those   doors into our country but they're going   to come in Legally they're gonna come a   little so I just want you to understand   we will also repeal the obama-clinton   defense II question and rebuild our   badly depleted military have to do   greatest people but we're not doing it   we're hurting them that means more   resources and investment in Air Force   Space Command at Peterson Air Force Base   Buckley Air Force Base and Cheyenne   Mountain Air Force   a lot more big beneficiary we do love   the air force around here don't worry   but we don't want our young great pilots   flying an equipment that's so old that   they don't even make parts for it   anymore and that's what's happening   that's what's happening I'm honored to   have the endorsement of more than 200   top Admirals and generals and 22 medal   of honor recipients Hillary and our   failed establishment have spent six   trillion dollars on wars in the Middle   East that we never win and now it's in   worse shape than ever before I mean the   Middle East is a disaster was it like   this when they started this all mess to   total disaster now you have the great   migration all over Europe has asked the   folks in Germany how they're doing as   the people in France and Paris and all   the different places as the people of   France how they're doing not good let me   tell you in fact really really bad   people don't even want to go there   anymore they've dragged us into foreign   wars that have made us less safe shipped   our jobs and wealth to other countries   and left our borders wide open at home   isn't that amazing we fight for other   countries that half the people in this   room have never even heard of tremendous   money more importantly blood blood we   lose our great people we fight for these   countries to have borders and yet at   home we don't fight for our own border   that will change on november eighth   a trump administration will never ever   put the interests of a foreign country   before the interests of our country from   now on it's going to be America first   to all Americans I say it's time for   change it's time for leadership just   think about what we can accomplish in   the first 100 days of a trump   administration we are going to have the   biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and   Hillary is going to raise your taxes   such things you know she wants to raise   your taxes very very substantial we're   going to eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation killing a cop   cancel every illegal Obama executive   order protect religious liberty   Wow   that's very impressive that's impressive   religious liberty got bigger hands   bigger closed in a tax cut that's that's   great I love that rebuild our military   and take care of our great veterans   finally   we're going to provide school choice and   put an end to common core bring our   education loca   we are going to support the great men   and women of law enforcement and save   our Second Amendment which is under   scene   and appoint justices to the United   States Supreme Court who will uphold and   defend the Constitution of the United   it's time to cut our ties with failed   politicians of the past Hillary Clinton   is the candidate of yesterday we are the   movement of the future   that's why I walk or drive your ballot   and put it in the box please don't put   it in the mail don't put it in the mail

we have lots   of energy and we love the people and we   love the people in particular that be   because it was my first state it meant   so much for me and I used to come up   thank you I feel the same way but I used   to come up and we used to have meetings   with people and they kept talking about   heroin heroin heroin I tell the story   all over New Hampshire because it's so   different than these beautiful little   valleys and the trees and the lakes and   the beautiful roads that we just wrote   over and you talk about heroin and it   doesn't work it just sort of doesn't   seem right but it's a tremendous problem   here and it's a tremendous problem all   over the country and we're going to   close up that border we're going to   build a wall you know we got the ice   endorsement just yesterday ice great   people and we got the Border Patrol   endorsement and the border patrol agents   endorses 16,500 and sheriff joe endorsed   us Sheriff Joe tough sheriff joe is   tough and good but getting the ice   yesterday was a tremendous thing for us   so I just want to make a quick remark   and then we'll start with Howie and I   know it's very hot in here and we want   to keep this small and by the way they   were saying this is practice for sunday   this isn't bright this has nothing to do   with sunday we're just here because we   just wanted to be here and you know   Hillary frankly they talk about debate   prep that's not debate prep she's   resting she's resting   and I want to be with the American   people I want to be with the people from   New Hampshire as you want to live debate   though tonight we'll discuss many issues   of great importance to New Hampshire and   few states in America have been hurt   worse by the trade policies of my   opponent and you know that NAFTA has   been a disaster signed by her husband   and you've lost nearly one in three jobs   think of that I mean think of it one in   three jobs since NAFTA and China make   deals we made deals with China World   Trade Organization what a disaster that   was supported by Hillary Clinton but the   NAFTA deal signed by her husband all   that we did a great thing two days ago   when he was willing to say how bad   Obamacare was I was crazy that was   pretty good the open border policies and   I just wrote this out but I feel it so   important the open border policies of   Hillary Clinton including catch and   release another terrible practice have   allowed a massive influx of drugs into   New Hampshire and frankly in two states   all over our country almost every state   and its really fueled the tremendous   heroin and drug crisis that we have   we're going to close up those borders   folks believe me and I promise that to   you in New Hampshire more than anything   else I said and I talk about it no   matter where I go and I mentioned this   state because it was really the first   glimpse I got to have serious the   problem we have they're poisoning our   youth they're poisoning more than are   you they're poisoning everybody but   they're poisoning our youth stuff enough   out there our youth doesn't have a   chance with what's happening and we're   not going to let it happen anymore and   we're going to help the people that are   so badly addicted we're going to help   [Applause]   so I'm going to bring your jobs back my   jobs are leaving like you never saw   before record levels i'm going to stop   the drugs from coming in i'm going to   create school choice and we're going to   get rid of common core which is a   disaster and we're going to create   something very special for every   disadvantaged child in this country of   which we have far too many we're going   to repeal and replace Obamacare which   bill admitted this week is a crazy   system can you believe hey least he's   honest boy has he suffered can you   imagine can you imagine that as he has   he suffered but he said it's a crazy   system that doesn't make sense and   doesn't work and where people end up   with premiums doubled and coverage cut   in half I couldn't have said it better   myself I've been saying it hey I've been   saying it for two years longer I know   I'm gonna put him on the campaign oh I'm   sure they do you think anybody's called   him and said let's recheck he did a   minor retraction but you could see he   wasn't happy about it remember Jonathan   Gruber do we remember the name I don't   ever forget Jonathan Gruber the   architect of the bill admitted it was   sold on lies remember that sold he   thought he was talking to his friend   unfortunately as friendted turned out   not to be such a good friend because his   friend had a little cell phone going   those cell phones are brutal just like   emails a brutal unless you want to   delete them all   unless you delete about 33,000 but   Jonathan Gruber the architect of   Obamacare admitted was sold on lies and   talked about the stupidity of the   American voter right remember that the   stupidity of the American voter the only   stupidity was that the politicians who   ignored the American people and forced   this thing absolutely forced it down   their throat and Hillary Clinton wants   to double down she wants to make it even   worse I mean that's ultimately what's   going to happen in me you've seen what   we're going to do you can have much much   better health care at a much lower price   and people are going to be very happy   extremely happy and we're going to take   care of those that are disadvantaged   they can't afford to do what others   can't afford to do but you're going to   be spending and we're going to take care   of them better than they're being taken   care of now but you're going to have   health care that works you're going to   have health care where companies compete   to get your business and come up with   plans that you haven't even seen or   thought about right now it'll be a   beautiful thing to see and I'm sure   we'll be talking about it on sunday   night during the debate because there's   no way we'll lose this issue it's a   disaster Obamacare is a disaster   we're going to create a more honest   government our government as a disaster   how about the 1.7 billion in cash that   was given to a rant cash remember was   going to be four hundred million turned   out to be one point seven billion in   case you know what that is that's more   than this room that's you would put it   probably in hundreds although is all   different currencies from different   nationalities maybe they didn't want   american dollars they said anybody so   stupid to make a deal like this we don't   want their money but can you imagine   this these people they never saw   anything like it and by the way that's   not going to fight terror they got   plenty of money that they use in a fight   that's going to the swiss bank accounts   okay just in case you had any questions   all right anyway we gave it to them and   boy did we give it to them so i want to   let you know that we are going to be a   country that's going to be run properly   and i'm going to be by the time this   finishes i'll be in for tremendous   amounts of money tremendous amounts of   money that i fund myself we also have a   lot of wonderful people in terms of   small donations and that's coming and   fantastically and we have some people   that just feel very good about our   country under proper leadership but   we're spending a lot of money and we're   doing it ourselves and we're very proud   of it we're going to be very proud of   our country and what people call up to   ask for certain favors that are bad for   the country but good for them the nice   part i don't even have to take their   phone call I don't need them I don't   have to take this   before we go any further I want to send   our thoughts our hearts are with all of   the people and prayers to the millions   in the path of what's now known as   hurricane Matthew it looks like it's a   big one and it's going to be a bad one   it looks like hopefully it takes that   right turn but it looks like it's going   in the opposite direction not good   there's one of the strongest storms to   hit in many decades and our neighbors in   florida georgia and the carolinas are in   a direct path that seems southeast   florida has taken the brunt we have a   lot of friends in Florida lot of a lot   of buildings a lot of investments in   Florida lot of great employees in   florida southeast florida's taking the   brunt of the storm to all of my friends   in Florida please know that we are   praying for you and everyone in the path   you got to take care of yourself you've   got to get out of the area you've got to   listen you have a great governor   Governor Scott and you gotta listen   because it could be a it could be a   really really bad one so it's going to   be a rough couple of days and maybe   beyond that but we'll see what the path   ultimately is we've seen the damage   throughout the Caribbean and Cuba the   Bahamas Haiti and others in fact they   say in Haiti almost 270 people they   think around 270 people have already   been killed by this terrible stone so to   the folks in haiti and all over we're   going to be helping you will be with you   and we send our best wishes and prayers   we have a tremendous problem that i   think is brewing right now as we speak   here so well know in about four or five   hours i just spoke to rick scott and   Governor Christie just spoke to rick   Scott and it looks like four or five   hours away so we'll well no but whatever   happens we're with everybody because it   is it looks like it's going to be a very   bad one may be the worst in a long   period of time okay with that Howie Carr   has been   amazing he's been very I don't know if   he's allowed to support but he sounds   like he supports me a lot I'm not sure   that he's still out there I'm not sure   he's allowed to but I think probably had   but he certainly been amazing and he's   very talented guy he's a terrific guy   with a terrific family so when we came   up and a lot of people wanted us to do   this we said let's get Howie so hey   let's go you have some questions I do   and I have a clock down on the floor   there that says two minutes okay now do   you want me to call you when it goes   over two minutes like I'll tell you what   I'll make a deal if I'm doing well don't   call me if I'm answering the question   poorly please call me immediately in   fact you could go okay you could go in   30 seconds you could do it all right all   right all right all right okay go ahead   okay the first question some of these   are I have the names and if I have the   name I'll just ask the person to stand   up this is a Matthew in bedford new   hampshire matthew is Matthew Matthew   here hi Matthew hi Matthew okay Matthew   says after the first debate the media   and even some within the party suggested   that you should have gone after Hillary   more did you hold back and do you plan   on criticizing her more this weekend   yeah I did hold back i thought it was   just inappropriate to say what I was   really thinking I would say and I held   back i think for I think for good reason   I think for good reason I'd much rather   have it be on policy and I didn't like   getting into the into the gutter and so   I did go back I also i mean honestly   this was you know the Commission the   so-called commission on presidential   debates give me a break did you see   where they came from one of them comes   from the Hillary camp the head person   how's your microphone work with this   microphone is wonderful but I had a   problem with the mic we had a guy inside   the room oscillating my mic was it that   the mic didn't work and you know it's   interesting i went there a little bit   before and I said boy that Mike is so   great unfortunately when I went to talk   they turn the mic up and down and you   saw it everybody in the room side so we   had a real problem and the head of the   debate set   your writer was a serious problem told   this to Mayor Giuliani it was a serious   problem after the debate an hour and a   half he said and now that the debates   over I'm going back stage to find out   what was wrong I said oh great that help   but I felt that I really felt that I   wanted to keep it on as high a level as   possible let's see what happens I mean   let's see what happens I think we're all   better off if we can do that because it   is about issues it is about power sander   you kept it in a minute 20 good what do   you see is the biggest foreign policy   failures of the last 15 years oh well do   we have about what 24 hours to talk   about this look we've had failures at   every level we've had failures I think   the Iran deal is one of the worst deals   I've ever seen okay it's going to lead   to nuclear weapons I was with Bibi   Netanyahu the other day and we talked   and we talked about it and not to reveal   what he said but i will tell you i can   tell you what i said this is horrible   for israel it's horrible for our country   it's a horrible deal because over a   period of time over a short period of   time it leads to within ten years and   it's going to be soon to them that they   going to end up with nuclear weapons and   they have like a path on top of it we   gave them back 150 billion dollars we   obviously paid ransom for our hostages   obviously you know Obama says this had   nothing to do well why did they delay it   until all this money came in but most   importantly just to pay a deal and I'm   all for deals because I happen to think   that nuclear is just about the biggest   problem that we have in the world today   i think it's one of you know Obama   thinks its global warming I think it's   no clear and in the hands of the wrong   players this is devastating there's no   winner there's never going to be a   winner with nuclear believe me and so I   think deals look fine but they have to   be good deals the deal made by secretary   Kerry he never left the table he just   agreed agreed agreed he'd want something   that say no and he'd agree so said but   there's one example of a just horrible   horrible thing we should have never gone   into Iraq should never gone into Iraq   but of equal importance or   almost equal importance is the way we   got out Obama took us out with Hillary   Clinton create this incredible vacuum   Isis was formed a lot of different   problems happened and totally disable us   you know the surge whether you were in   favor of going in or not the surge   really did work then all of a sudden   boom not only that we announced always   we're leaving here we're leaving then   what how about muscle did you see muscle   where they announced yesterday I'm   seeing all about we're going to attack   Mosul we're going to attack muscle I   mean why do they say that now a lot of   the bad ombres are in muscle the leaders   of Isis they think but they're not there   anymore because they say hey wait a   minute a go to attack let's go someplace   else isn't there an element of surprise   remember when we were young and we were   studying history and they talk about   some of the great generals and the great   attacks and was called the element of   surprise would it be nice if we attacked   first and talked about our great victory   later now you're not seriously who's   gonna   it's almost like they're wasting their   time attacking Muslim because everyone   that we want is going to be gone you   have all civilians and there'll be   tremendous death and carnage but the   people that we want they're going to say   hey which are the leaders get the hell   out of here it's a very very sad thing   we are being run by people that are   incompetent I will tell you that there's   a Charlene from San Burton around she   here Charlene I know oh yeah Charlene   says mr. Trump I'm an eighth generation   American of Hispanic descent I live in   New Hampshire in California you have my   vote I want to help other Hispanics see   the truth and then she talks about how   with the current administration is the   border security sanctuary cities or   increasing drugs and crime she says   Charlene says what would you say to   convince Hispanics who are deceived by   Barack Obama Hillary Clinton and the   biased media to vote for you well first   of all thank you very much and I   appreciate it interestingly i was   listening the other day there was a   gentleman who owns a big radio station   hispanic mostly all hispanic callers and   he was arguing with one of the house he   said no you don't us in the people that   are calling in hispanics they love Trump   they're all for Trump and he said I was   even surprised but now I'm for Trump   also you know I mean this is happening   more and more I just got back from Las   Vegas what we gave a tremendous I mean   we had a tremendous crowd of people a   lot of Hispanics Latinos they like to be   called in that area you know that right   hispanics and latinos but we had   tremendous response and just tremendous   was an outpouring of love amazing and   you know people that are here legally   they don't want people coming across the   border illegally taking their jobs   taking their homes taking whatever they   want to take and we want people to come   in now I want people to come into our   country so bad but they have to come in   Legally you know we have a country and   we have laws we have a border and if you   don't have a border you don't have a   country but I think the biggest surprise   to big surprises we're going to do great   with african-americans you look at   what's happening with the inner cities   it's a disgrace and the Democrats have   been running them for up to a hundred   years unbroken   and the African Americans believe me I   think we're doing and you see how that   the numbers are changing one thing they   don't have a lot of confidence in   Hillary Clinton she's lied to him for   years she never she doesn't produce she   does she just doesn't produce but I   think we're going to do great with the   African Americans you look at the   poverty and the inner cities you look at   the crime in the inner cities you look   at the education and there's no jobs and   we're going to do fantastic with the   Hispanics I believe that do it well   keeping it down right yeah Karen   Whittaker from San down here in San down   Karen hi Karen oh thank you thank you I   like this audience I like those audio   how do you define the income range for   middle class it cannot be based on where   you live because the US tax codes do not   discriminate based on geography well   look out the way I look at it the middle   class has been forgotten in this country   taxes are too high jobs have been taken   away from you are a lot of our companies   a lot of great companies have left our   country they've gone to Mexico and other   places China is making so much of our   product we don't make product anymore   anywhere near like we used to and i will   tell you such a great question because   our middle class has been treated so   badly by the politicians i mean it's   like forgotten and we're lowering taxes   as you know way down for the middle   class we're changing the tax structure   completely we had seven brackets now we   have three and we'll bring it down   actually for those making not a lot it's   zero and we don't want them to send in   because that's huge bureaucratically and   extremely costly but we're bringing the   rates down to numbers that are much   lower you've seen the numbers much lower   and you're going to have a much lower   tax base hillary clinton's raising your   taxes way up I don't even know what   she's thinking she's rate we're already   the highest tax nation in the world just   about they can maybe find every once in   a while there so they'll fact check me   well know there is a nation that you   never heard of where it's slightly   higher we are just about industrial of   the industrialized nations with the   highest tax payers in the world with the   highest   tax nation in the world our business   taxes are going to be brought from   thirty-five percent to fifteen percent   were cutting regulations which are   absolutely we want regulation for   environmental we want regulation for   safety but the regulations are massive   ally their massive and we're cutting the   regulations at a tremendous clip and i   would say seventy percent of the   regulations can go it's it's just   stopping businesses from growing and i   think you're going to see a tremendous   change in this country we're going to   see jobs come back we're going to see   companies come back into our country and   right now they're just leaving it's a   one-way street out we have a one-way   street right out of the country and   they're going largely to Mexico and   other places but Mexico is the eighth   wonder of the world I tell the story a   lot I have a friend who builds plants   and he builds these massive plants and   he says done it you have to see what's   going on in Mexico I said how about our   country he goes not so much we're going   to switch that around a little bit and   we'll get along great with Mexico by the   way but we've got to switch that around   it's been a one-way highway out of the   United States is kapha see in   londonderry here kapha city kappa i   recently graduated magna cum laude with   a BS in chemistry and i'm having a lot   of trouble finding a job what's your   plan to bring jobs back to America well   that's the biggest problem and that   takes place with so many and and even   though it's over a hundred degrees in   this room don't feel but you know this   room was not meant for this many people   you do know that I heard the other night   I was making a speech and we had   tremendous massive crowds and it was   really hot so I'm a little warm and   there might have been a little bit of   sweat and one of these dishonest people   said Donald Trump was sweating tonight   said sweat it was a hundred degrees   and guess what we're all sweating   tonight also right that's okay that's   good that's healthy the biggest problem   you have is people go to college I mean   that's great getting out magna that's   fantastic that means real smart but   people go to college they work they   borrow money they're up to here they're   up to their their neck and debt and then   they get out and they can't get a job I   mean it's such a massive problem they   can't get a job because are really good   jobs are gone and they've gone to other   countries and so many other countries   are making our product I want to see the   day when you could get those great marks   in that incredible profession which you   love probably or you wouldn't have been   so high up in the class right at the top   but I want to see the day when we can   have those jobs back in this country at   the highest level I want to see the day   when Apple will make their iPhones in   this country instead of making them in   China and Vietnam and all over the place   okay and believe me if I'm president   that's going to happen and I use Apple   as an example but in all fairness Apple   makes all its products all over the   place they're not making them here   mostly in China now Vietnam which is   becoming very strong for this thinking   to stop making them here they're going   to stop making them here we have the   people we have the most unbelievable   people if I learned one thing and going   around cuz we started on june sixteenth   of last year and I've gotten to know the   people and we have by far the biggest   rallies that people have seen far bigger   than Bernie and he was second but far   bigger now Bernie's aren't so big by the   way they're very small Bernie made a big   mistake by the way Bernie Bernie Sanders   would have been legendary if he didn't   make a deal with the devil when he made   that deal his stock went way down it   went way down I mean honestly even as   somebody that is you know disagrees with   him on a lot of things other than trade   we agree very much on trade very very   much entre except I'll do things about   it because I like free trade but I want   to make great deal free trade but he was   right on trade because our country is   being ripped off or jobs on everything   but we're going to have a country that   makes product again we're going to have   a country that Apple and these other   great companies are going to make their   product in our country and we're gonna   have lots of people working including   yourself we have to do that okay thank   you is Bob Swanson here Bob Swanson hi   Bob it's one of my favorite questions   when you become president and you can   you assure the American people that   you're going to clean house from the top   at the FBI Justice Department State   Department and the VA and in what order   would you start well I guess we'll be   talking about this for a while to come   but I have to tell you it's one of the   saddest things I've ever seen happen to   our country what's happened with Hillary   Clinton where you send emails where they   send a subpoena and they want all of   your emails I mean if you're in private   business and you do what she did it's   called the whose girl okay they the   United States Congress Congress sends a   subpoena wanting emails and she gets to   subpoena and she deletes 33,000 EMS   ended many other things including lying   all over the place and you see people   who have suffered greatly including   General Petraeus for doing a tiny   fraction of what she did that's only   because well we're not gonna we can't   stay here all night and talk about but   the lie she told to Congress the lie she   told to the people but the lie she told   to Congress and then you see an FBI give   her a know tape know anything no   swearing in I believe they said no   swearing you don't do even swear in and   they questioned her on the fourth of   July and then they released their   finding on Labor Day on right before   Labor Day when everyone's gone and God   they got here they got in there I think   what's happened with respect to because   I have such respect for the people in   the FBI and I have such incredible   respect for the FBI what's happened to   the FBI and two   justice department at the highest level   honestly I think it's one of the saddest   things I've ever seen in this country it   whether we like it or don't like it to   look at what's happened and to look at   the way that's been handled and you know   every time I speak this is mentioned the   subject of the people are going crazy   the people of this country are very very   angry very very angry and i would think   I don't know this but i would think that   some of these great FBI agents and the   people that work within the FBI i would   imagine they are just furious it's   what's happened to the reputation of the   FBI so I mean I think it's an amazing   question honestly it's like we're a   third world country it's one of the   saddest things that I've ever seen   happen in this country and it happened   to justice and that's probably I guess   the way you feel also right yeah it's   very sad we have some quick follow-up   what would you do with call me I just am   very disappointed I mean you you know   when he read the charges and he's going   1 2 3 4 and I'm saying wow they're going   to do the right thing and and he goes   essentially however it was I mean it was   amazing it was amazing to go after point   after point and that was only a few of   them so it's very disappointing it's   very disappointing sharon osbourne from   Auburn Sharon Sharon for the   conservative holdouts mr. Trump who are   not on the Trump bandwagon yet what can   you say to convince them that your   support for traditional conservative   issues of free markets the Bill of   Rights and the rest of the Constitution   mean they should endorse you well you   know we don't have too many Howie I'll   be honest with you you know the press   likes to report you have some of these   long-term people that have done such a   bad job you look at the look at the   problem our country's in I would never   use these people and they know that so   then they announce in a group that   they're going over to Hillary right you   understand and they announce in a group   but you know we have   mendes support including a couple of   your very distinguished folks from New   Hampshire who were against me who are   now for me and you're allowed to   announce the names but we have   tremendous support in New Hampshire one   of them was very tough and very smart go   ahead John Sununu that's show I'd watch   him and say boy this is tough his son is   four points up that's good well that's   good because I'm a I mean I I thought it   was terrific I met him the other day and   father and son and I think I think   they're great people but he was tough   I'll tell you what he was he was really   hunting for Trump and you know what I   respect somebody that can go the other   way it's not that easy a pivot as you   would say but I very much appreciate the   Sununu family and the fact that they are   with me and I am with them and they   going to do very well he's going to do   very well and I see the numbers and and   you know one of the things that have   really happened they all thought ohh   truck because look I've never done this   and but I've done very well in my life   and business and done a lot of good   things and but I've never done this so   all of the reports well you'll take down   the senator and he'll take down this   center do you know how well the   Republicans are doing I guess there's a   gentleman in Illinois that's not doing   so well this guy was actually taking out   ads against me I said are you sure he's   a Republican maybe he's a Democrat and   he's not doing well but hey that's his   problem I mean you know he was not for   me but if you look at and he was there   was for political reasons but if you   look at what's going on now they're all   talking about fact the other day I saw   very interesting one of the announcement   you know Donald Trump is having a very   positive effect on these races the   Republicans are going to hold they're   doing terrific Lee well far better than   anyone thought and frankly we are   winning states and we're going to win   some states that would never in a   million years you know this being play I   mean we have some states like we're   doing great in Colorado somebody else   wouldn't do well nobody else would do   well we're doing great i think well   bleeding colorado and one of the poles   as you know just came out Willie   Colorado I just left we're leading a lot   of places and or doing at least very   competitively in a lot of states that   absolutely would not be four Republicans   and you know one of the funny things   they do the maps and remember two months   ago I'd watch two different people that   do the maps and in a very small pet it's   tougher for the Republicans I have to   tell you but they said there's a very   small path but I was watching the other   day and the same person was single wow   this path is getting a lot wider doesn't   mean they were happy about it but the   path now there's four different paths   because there was one little one hates   overall nate silver's been you know he   didn't predict us in the primary and he   had never called a loser before I mean   you know he's always been on the right   side of of what happened in terms of at   least his predictions and he didn't   predict me in the primaries and in all   fairness you know never seen me never   spoke to me never saw what we did you   know we had 17 very talented people and   one by one by one it was a beautiful   sight to watch wasn't it beautiful being   pink and by the way how those people   most of them endorsed me ben Carson   chris Christie so many of them endorsed   me and they're great endorsements Scott   Walker has been incredible no pets he   helped pence to Mike Pence by the way   has been fantastic and he did a great   job last night he's good at did a great   he did a great job lesson that brings me   to another question from Louis from   Brent wedding Louis Thank You Louis did   you really say Louis asked you were you   upset about mr. Pence's debate success   as John Harwood said John Harwood was   the worst moderator out of all the   debates we had how many did we have 11   or 12 he was so bad this kind of nothing   about me I was so happy and I saw today   that somebody on CNN the Clinton news   network who knows nothing about us you   know they use John King actually he's a   nice guy like him on the maps he does a   good job with the maps I like him better   now than I did a couple of months ago   cuz a couple of months ago I had no   chance now all of a sudden that map is   getting very rare   but John King said you know they always   have a source there was ever source a   source within nobody talks to him nobody   stopped because he's like the enemy he's   like the enemy but he said and a few   other people said Donald Trump was at   first happy and then he was unhappy   because Mike Pence did so well I said   unhappy with jumping up and down he was   so good and I'll tell you what he's a   great human being he's a you can't root   against him you can't but I was telling   chris i was telling Chris Chris I said   can you imagine these people are saying   that I would have loved to have you know   seen them not too well because that   makes me look better these people that's   why a guy like John King has stayed in   the same position for like hello busy   but it's tienen hey I used to say I   think someday he'll be an anchor guess   what he's still doing the maps but but   no I was so happy and I i mean i can i   can give you my word of this i was so   happy that Mike did well and I was   rooting him on and we were talking all   during the day and I was giving us some   ideas and we're running things by each   other and it's so disconcerting when you   hear even tonight they said Donald Trump   is going to New Hampshire to practice   for sunday this has nothing to do with   sunday and it's like they make you into   like a child and this is I love the   people of New Hampshire if this was set   up a little while ago they were going to   cancel it and I said well you gonna   cancel it well you wanted to bake prep I   said forget the bay prep I mean give me   a break do you really think that Hillary   Clinton is debate prepping for three or   four days Hillary Clinton is resting   okay she's resting she wants to build up   her energy for sunday night and you know   what that's fine but uh the the   narrative is so foolish I'm here for one   reason i love the people of New   Hampshire I said I was going to be here   and I'm here very simple   this one this one is unsigned but it's a   good question what and that's trouble   would you give to young Americans   looking to achieve the American drink   always go into what you love doing and   you may have parents that are trying to   push you one way or another but you know   what you love you have to do what you   love and I say this all the time I say   it in speeches and everything I mean   I'll speak in front of young people   because I love doing it and I say always   follow your dream always go into what   you love and never ever quit or give up   I've seen a lot of people over the years   big people not so big usually it's not   so big because if they quit they're not   going to get so big but the most   successful people I've ever met are the   people that never quit they never give   up they just don't take no for an answer   so do something that you really love   doing because then it's not work and   never ever quit or give up all right do   one or two more thank you I think you   think you've dealt with this one before   it's from ALB all the sorrow over there   hello al I'll say yeah I end up al now   wants to know what you're gonna   [Applause]   al wants to know what you're going to do   about the VA how are you going to make   it possible the veterans as al can tell   you and as a lot of the veterans in this   room because I recognize some of you and   and I've become very close to the vets   and a lot of it started with New   Hampshire to be honest in Iowa but I   really got close to the vets and I'll   tell you what in many cases they're   living in hell what's going on with the   Veterans Administration between the   corruption the long long waits 22   suicides today I thought that was a typo   when I heard 22 suicides a day said   that's impossible 22 suicides a day much   of it caused by the fact that they can't   get to see doctors Howie they wait in   line four five and six days and at the   end of the sixth day the doctor says   sorry you know I'm going on vacation and   actually the Veterans Administration and   the vets tell me this they have some   really great doctors but getting to see   them is sometimes almost impossible we   are going to solve finally the problem   of the Veterans Administration we have   illegal immigrants that in many cases   are treated better than our great   veterans and you know that and everybody   knows that they're being treated better   than our veterans and that's not going   to happen one of the things we're going   to do is the lines are impossible   getting to see a doctor is in many cases   just days and days when that   circumstance happens we're going to let   our veterans go across the street around   the corner two miles away and see a   doctor private or a hospital public or   private where they're looking for work   where they have wonderful people and   they're looking for work take care of   their problem and we will pay the bill   and that's going to be the cheapest   thing we can do it's going to be the   cheapest thing we can do and   and Al can tell you what a lot of the   vets that I recognized in the room they   can tell you everybody's in love with   the plan and we're going to keep the via   but we're gonna we're going to keep the   Veterans Administration we're going to   keep the hospital's we're going to keep   the buildings because I think that's   important you know we have to take care   of our vets these are people that we   wouldn't be here if it weren't for the   vets but but when they're waiting in   line for and they know it's there's no   end in sight and honestly they're dying   they need a simple procedure they need a   prescription they need something very   easy and they end up dying and it's a   very sad thing so they're going to be   able to go across the street to a public   private hospital to a doctor and we're   going to take care of our vets for the   first time we're really going to take   care of our vets okay this creep from   Nashua here p from Nashua Pete from   Nashua says Hillary Clinton wants to   give Social Security and Medicare to   illegal immigrants through citizenship   won't this bankrupt the programs well   let me tell you you've heard that and   most people didn't even believe it but   that's true and you know she's open   border she wants people to just flow   through look when the border patrol   agents 16,500 and when ice when they   come out and they've never endorsed the   presidential candidate before but these   are great people that want to do their   jobs you know it's much harder for them   to do their job said to just stand back   right now it's stand back let them in   it's much and catch and release which is   a disaster but when they want to do   their jobs and it's much more difficult   and they come out and endorse Trump   who's going to have them do their jobs   and we're going to build a wall and   where to stop things from coming and   look wigga to stop and this was the   Pledge I made to New Hampshire more than   any other place because this is where I   really couldn't believe it but I said if   I win and if I become president first   get the nomination that happened become   president I promised the people of New   Hampshire that we are going to stop this   crap from coming into your state one   hundred percent   one hundred percent and it can be done   and it can be done even before the wall   goes up the wall is a necessary edge of   you know I asked the patrol I asked   really the ice folks that endorse me and   I asked the Border Patrol folks that   address they said how important is the   wall and you know I'm so committed to   the wall I was pretty sure they were   going to say this but I wasn't a hundred   percent they said mr. Trump it is   absolutely necessary for us to do our   proper job which made me you know gave   me a little additional security as far   as the wall is concerned we need the   wall we have to stop the drugs heroin   but many drugs but we have to stop the   drugs from pouring into our country and   believe me it is poisoning our country   and it's poisoning are you our youth and   we're going to stop it and we're going   to stop it fast long before the wall   gets up we're gonna start there well   fast I get them built fast but I'll tell   you long before we're going to stop that   poison from flowing into our country   okay one more will do another question   I'm gonna ask you I'm gonna ask you why   the kind of question Hillary Clinton   gets sometimes I mean easy here right   she gets easy ones that's what I mean   you ever noticed by the way did you see   the difference I'm getting boom boom   boom with her what would you do to fix   the economy of course that's actually a   much tougher question than you would   understand but and she doesn't have a   clue but you see the questions i was   getting lara from Hampton New Hampshire   are you here that's Laura ok let's have   a fun question what is one of your   earliest memories as a child and why do   you think it stands out and then she   says go Donald thank you thank you I   think just the relationship I had with   my parents you know my father built   houses in brooklyn and queens and   departments and he was a very good   negotiator I'd sit at his knee and it   wasn't that he taught me he didn't   really say son you have to learn but   he'd be on the telephone negotiating   with a plumber or an electrician or a   sheet rocker and I would hear this and   I'd   playing with blocks at his knee on the   floor and I'd be listening and just it   was always so vivid and he was always   negotiating and you know what that's   what we need in this country because   people are running away with our country   you look at what's going on whether it's   the border whether it's are depleted   military the greatest people on earth   are military people but they have old   equipment you saw the piece they did on   many of the networks where they show   fighter jets where they're 18 years old   they're so old that they don't make the   parts of him with these are fighter jets   that our people are flying now and they   have to go into plain graveyards they   have to go into graveyards to get parts   and they have to go into museums to get   parts because they don't make the parts   anymore now we need a strong military we   need to protect our Second Amendment we   need to take care of our vets we need   borders we need great education getting   rid of common core so important we need   so many things and by the way one thing   and I know John Sununu and a lot of   other people felt this was so important   when they came out so strongly United   States Supreme Court we need we lost a   great justice justice scalia great   justice we need great justices who are   going to uphold our Constitution and if   Hillary Clinton gets in you're going to   have a much different country so so many   people feel that's so important I   personally feel it's one of the most   important things defense always being we   have to defend our country and we have   to stop people coming in from parts of   the world where they're looking to do us   harm believe me and they're pouring in   and Hillary Clinton wants to have them   come in at a rate of five hundred and   fifty percent more than President Obama   we are going to stop it and you know the   statement we are going to make America   great again and it's going to happen   quickly so thank you very much everybody   thank you I got one more question for   you Donald I'm going to let you read it   and remember where you are tonight as   you answer this question oh the World   Series ooh look oh of course it's busted   Thank You Donald Trump New Hampshire   round of applause Donald J Trump the   next president of the United States   Thank You Donald Trump   [Applause]   good luck to Florida good luck in   wisconsin tomorrow and good luck in st.

[Music]   [Music]   [Music]   hey   [Music]   I   [Music]   [Music]   [Applause]   you   thank you very much everybody so I just   looked over there you won't believe this   there are three times more people   standing over there then over here   so that I asked a simple question   whoever set this deal up why didn't they   move this out to there so that those   people could have been over here right   who are the geniuses to set this up   that's too bad that's too bad I feel so   badly 2,000 zand thousands of people   over there   oh well that's what we have to put up   with in life right real geniuses   [Applause]   it's great to be back in Minnesota today   so important for me to come here and   campaign for your vote I've been here   many times before as you know and Hilary   doesn't even I mean she doesn't even   bother to come here she should be   penalized don't vote for her she'll be a   lousy president anyway believe me now   she refuses to campaign in Minnesota so   you really want a president who doesn't   care enough about your vote that she   never shows up she never came she never   came here I'm asking for the support of   every voter in the state Democrat   Republican independent first-time voters   of which there are many many many who   want to take our government back from   the corrupt political class in   Washington DC I'm asking for the votes   of students and parents and retired   americans union workers African   Americans Hispanic Americans and all   Americans who are tired of a government   that works for wall street and the   special interest but not for the people   not the people   it's time for all Americans to unite and   take back our government   I'm very honored to have won the mock   vote of the high school students in   Minnesota you know that thing was all   over the nation   probably one of the reasons I'm here   we're doing incredibly in the Minnesota   poll but a couple of weeks ago I kept   here everybody's tell me did you hear   you won the high school vote in   Minnesota said no tell me about well the   kids know better than we do right   oftentimes hey there's a great vent   right here this election is all about   creating a better future for our   children our failed establishment has   brought us nothing but poverty at home   and disaster overseas that's what we   have disaster the wars we never win   we're tired of economic and foreign   policies that have led our country dry   we owe 20 trillion dollars it's time for   real change that puts people back in   charge and puts our people back to work   again this election will decide who runs   this country the corrupt political class   or you the American people that's the   choice   she's with them I'm with you   I used to be on the other side for a   long time but you know I love this   country and I saw what was happening not   only the wrong direction our country was   going to hell it was going to hell the   Iran deal so many things you could go   off from one by one and we'll discuss   some of them right now but I can tell   you this this is our last chance we're   not going to have another chance for   years you can forget it by that time   you'll have Supreme Court judges picked   for years you can forget it you'll never   have another shot this is it so we have   to get out we have to vote and you have   to make sure because I took a lot of   heat I came to Minnesota I took so much   heat they all said on television what is   he going to Minnesota you know these   guys have been saying this for me for   two years by the way so far in two years   I've been right and they've been wrong   they've been saying I can't believe he's   going to Minister you know real geniuses   I can't believe he's going to Minnesota   why would he be doing that why he   shouldn't be there he should be   elsewhere he should be and as I said   Hillary Clinton has not been here once   but he should not be in Minnesota I love   Minnesota the reason I'm here because   I've been here I know what's going to   happen I know what's going to happen in   two days we are going to win the great   state of Minnesota and we are going to   win back the White House   real change begins with immediately   repealing and replacing Obamacare it's a   disaster   it's just been announced that the   residents of Minnesota are going to   experience close to a sixty percent rate   increase in your premiums going to go   that iron   every single County in Minnesota is   losing and i will tell you losing big in   so many ways but you're losing all of   your insurers you know that right   the Democratic governor of your state   who pushed for this horrible health care   said the Affordable Care Act is no   longer affordable that's your governor   premiums to surgeon companies are   leaving it's yours of fleeing doctors   acquitting and deductibles are going   through the roof you have fifteen   sixteen seventeen thousand dollars in   deductibles yet Hillary Clinton wants to   double down on Obamacare making it even   more expensive it's going to be doubled   I'm asking for your vote so we can bring   sanity to the process so we can repeal   and replace Obamacare and save health   care for every family in Minnesota and   in our country   [Applause]   and I feel so guilty about those people   out of there oh those poor people   they're standing there looking at a wall   ah you're worse than I am so let as many   as you can in thank you feel badly don't   worry we're building the real wall it'll   be a real wall I know stop drugs from   coming into our country it will stop the   poison the poison drugs from coming into   our country and totally poisoning our   youth and plenty of others real change   up general Cartwright's not protected   four-star general could go to jail for   up to five years two weeks ago General   Petraeus wasn't protected   so many other people were not protected   she's protected by a rigged system she   shouldn't even be allowed to run for   president I'll tell you right now   she is the most corrupt person ever to   seek the presidency of the United States   my contract with the American voter   begins with a plan to end government   corruption and to take our country back   from the special interests and donors   I want the entire corrupt Washington   establishment to hear our words as we   all say together when we win or november   eight we are going to drain the swamp   and I'm going to help you big league on   immigration in Minnesota because I know   what's happening to you and it's not a   good thing it's not pretty at the core   of my contract is my plan to bring jobs   back to our country   America has lost one third of its   manufacturing job since NAFTA a deal   originally signed by Bill Clinton and   supported by Hillary America has lost   70,000 factory since China entered the   World Trade Organization another bill   and hillary back disaster minnesota   ranks fourth nationwide for the highest   share of jobs lost due to our trade   deficit with china did you know that   your fourth what least you're not first   and going to vote for the people that   did that to you I don't   why do I feel good about Minnesota I   I'll tell you one thing I'll tell you   one thing if I don't win Minnesota I'm   going to look real bad to those pundits   that I do not respect very much   and there are some of them right up   there the world's most dishonest people   the media totally dishonest me   [Applause]   they are the dishonest people hey send a   camera outside to take a look at the   crowd also and when Hillary Clinton was   Secretary of State our trade deficit   with china grew forty percent great job   Hilary we're living through the greatest   jobs left in the history of the world no   country has ever lost jobs like we've   lost Josh Ford laid off 794 workers and   st. Paul and move their jobs overseas   moneygram laid off 408 workers in   Brooklyn Center and move their jobs   overseas great bats laid off 200 workers   in Plymouth and move their jobs like so   many others to Mexico   not going to happen folks anymore it's   over it's over it's over   Smead manufacturing later 592 people in   Hastings and move their jobs to Mexico   ipn laid off 500 workers in Minneapolis   and move their jobs to India and various   other countries a trump administration   will stop the jobs from leaving America   and we will stop the jobs from leaving   Minnesota and we'll stop them   immediately to one of the reasons I ran   one of the main reasons I ran and so   simple if a company wants to leave   Minnesota fire their workers and move to   another country and then ship their   products back into the United States   through what will be a very very strong   border I promise you we will make them   pay a thirty five percent tax on those   problems   and I'll tell you what will happen not   very complicated they won't move they're   not going to move they're not going to   move our politicians are controlled by   special interests donors and others some   of them aren't very bright you know   you've been hearing this for years how   do we stop this terrible outflow they   could have stopped that most people   don't even think of these things but let   me tell you you put a tax on those   products when they make them they want   to move to Mexico it's a whole different   ball game folks they're not leaving this   thing with you and when we lower taxes   on business which we're going to do   we're going to start new businesses   businesses will expand could have a lot   of jobs we will also unleash American   energy including shale oil natural gas   and clean call we're going to put our   miners back to work we're going to put   our steel workers back to work we will   also cancel all harmful Obama   regulations that hurt Minnesota farmers   workers and small businesses big-league   you've been hurt   I'll tell you you know honestly because   i was looking at the stats i have like a   lot of time on error plans so I look at   stats doesn't sound like a very exciting   life but it is actually but Minnesota   has really been hurt so I say what the   hell do you want to put these same   people back into office for to say   [Applause]   we're going to be great for Minnesota we   will become a rich nation again but to   be a rich nation we must also be a safe   nation and you know what's going on   there   Oh minnesota minnesota do you know   what's going on do you know what I'm   talking about do you know what I'm   talking about I'll be politically   correct just not quietly not the whole   world knows what's happening in   Minnesota the whole world knows what's   happening to you Hilary wants a five   hundred and fifty percent increase in   Syrian refugees pouring into our country   and she wants virtually unlimited   immigration and refugee admissions from   the most dangerous regions of the world   to come into our country and to come   into Minnesota and you know it better   than anybody   her plan will import generations of   terrorism extremism and radicalism into   your schools and throughout your   communities your daven when I'm elected   president we will suspend the Syrian   refugee program and we will keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of our   country   [Applause]   how stupid how stupid are our leaders   how stupid are they to allow this down   here in Minnesota you've seen firsthand   the problems caused with faulty refugee   vetting with large numbers of Somali   refugees coming into your state without   your knowledge without your support or   approval and with some of them then   joining Isis and spreading their   extremist views all over a country and   all over the world   honestly it's hard to believe it's hard   to believe and everybody's reading about   the disaster taking place in Minnesota   everybody's reading about it you don't   even have the right to talk about it you   don't even know who's coming in you have   no idea you'll find out you'll find out   you've seen the recent terrorist knife   attack in st. cloud a trump   administration will not admit any   refugees without the support of the   local community where they are being   placed   the least they could do for you you've   suffered enough in Minnesota and we will   pause it missions from Terra prone   regions until a full security assessment   has been performed and until a proven   vetting mechanism has been established   horrible what they do horrible and if   you want people to just pour into   Minnesota all you have to do is vote for   Hillary Clinton because that's what   she's going to do just about   [Applause]   and I don't care where you come from I   don't care how liberal you are I don't   care how politically correct you are how   stupid this has been how stupid it's   better and you get the brunt of it   almost more than any other place   a trump administration will also secure   and defend the borders of the United   States and yes we will build a great   wall   Hilary supports totally open borders   there goes your country and strongly   support sanctuary cities like San   Francisco where Kate Steinle was   murdered by an illegal immigrant   deported at least five times thousands   of Americans would be alive today if not   for the open border policies of Obama   klijn   there's the tragic case of 90 year old   Earl Orlando a Minnesota farmer who was   brutally beaten by illegal immigrants   and left to bleed to death in his home   Earl's body was found with his hands   bound behind his back duct tape on his   mouth and blunt force injuries all over   his head his killers had criminal   records a mile long but they did not   meet the Obama administration's   priorities for removal and yet everybody   that knew these killers everybody that   knew them said please please get them   out they should be incarcerated don't   let them roam our communities a trump   administration will end this nightmare   of violence that you're having and that   plenty of others are having   we will stop illegal immigration deport   all criminal aliens and dismantle every   last criminal gang in cartel threatening   our citizens   we will also repeal the obama-clinton   defense sequester so the great deal they   make and rebuild our badly depleted   military   with flying jets that are almost 20   years old fighter jets they don't even   make the parts they go down to the   aeroplane graveyards and aeroplanes   museums to get parts for these planes   they don't make them anymore that's what   this country of ours the United States   of America that's what we're flying it's   embarrassing beresford for a great great   young pilots and all of the people that   are in our armed services i'm honored to   add the endorsement of more than 200 top   Admirals and generals and 22 medal of   honor recipients and many more calm   we had an event the other night 24,000   25,000 people right next to Fort Bragg   we had tremendous medal of honor   recipients we had generals we had advils   we had military people who's one of the   most amazing evenings I've ever seen in   a field people as far as the eye could   see Hillary and our failed establishment   have spent six trillion dollars on wars   in the Middle East that we never win and   now the Middle East is in worse shape   than it's ever been before it's a   disaster it's a disaster   and by the way if I were involved with   Mosul number one we would have been   involved number two we wouldn't give   them a four month notice we are going to   attack bosal in four months we are going   to attack them because we think that   Isis leaders are in Mosul so we are   going to go in and get those Isis   leaders for months and three months   later yes it's about three months is   we're going to attack two months then   one month then a week ago what we're   getting ready to attack then the attack   and all the leaders are gone   and the people they left behind are   fighting like hell and they're using   human shields think how bad it is   whatever happened to the word surprise   right whatever happens surprise the   element of surprise what happened what   happened why don't they go in quietly   knock the hell out of them take them out   and have a news conference a week later   you know why because we have a president   who is incompetent he's incompetent okay   we have a president who's incompetent   and I'll tell you this I'll tell you   this he shouldn't be campaigning you   know she can't do her own campaigning so   he's campaigning his wife is campaigning   bitin who said oh I'd like to take him   behind the gym me   I dream about that and everybody said I   wasn't that nice oh

oh he's a bully he's a   terrible person he's a terrible person   these people are the worst I'll tell you   they are though   [Applause]   our leaders have dragged us into foreign   wars that have made us less safe shift   our jobs and wealth to other countries   and left our borders wide open at home   so people flow in and drugs flow in like   it's candy like its water we send our   troops to foreign countries to defend   their borders but our politicians   reviews to defend our borders that will   change or November a folks gotta do it   gotta do it I want to show these people   they've been wrong about us for two   years two years we gotta show   thank you   thank you one of the anchors i was   watching coming in were landing and i   looked at this massive crowd and then i   looked at an even bigger crowd right   over here and he's saying yes we're here   with Donald Trump is a decent sized   crowd he has it we get more people at   our rallies then Hillary gets with   beyonce

jay-z and I like Beyonc I think it's   like but the language was terrible now   what they don't say the dishonest media   many of the audience which wasn't nearly   full by the way which they would never   say but many of the audience left during   the performance because it was   disgusting the words right they left you   know their political people that go in   and now they're hearing all this stuff   they left before by the time hillary got   up to speak there was practically nobody   there they just came to the performance   true by the time she gets up there   mostly gone then she goes home when she   goes to sleep birthday   we're going to make four more stops   after this Oh Minnesota you better prove   me right or these people will never ever   forget they'll never forget you better   prove me right men are you gonna prove   me right   I mean really watch your choice crooked   Hillary I mean that's not much of it a   trump administration will never ever put   the interests of a foreign country   before the interests of our country   definitely from now on it's going to be   America first don't Americans I say it's   time for leadership and it's time for   big change   Justin closing think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trump administration   we are going to have the biggest tax   cuts and Ronald Reagan   and Hillary Clinton is going to   substantially raise your taxes believe   it or not we already the highest tax   nation in the world we will save and   protect your Social Security and   Medicare   and Hilary wants to reduce and cut your   social security and your Medicare   benefits that's what's going to happen   we will eliminate every unnecessary   job-killing regulation we want clean air   we want clean water we want safety   that's what we want we'll cancel every   illegal obama executive order we will   protect your religious liberty   we're going to rebuild our military and   take great care finally of our veterans   our veterans have been mistreated   terrible we will provide school choice   and put an end to common core we're   bringing education local   we're going to support the men and women   of law enforcement these are great   people and save our Second Amendment   which is understood we will appoint   justices to the United States Supreme   Court who will uphold and defend the   Constitution of the United States   it's time to cut our ties with the fail   politicians of the past Hillary Clinton   is the candidate of yesterday folks   she's been here for 30 years she   complains always complaining i always   say i won the debates according to   virtually every did i win the debate   in fact that's when our numbers after   the last debate that's when our numbers   started to go up like a rocket ship we   won the debates and it was amazing and   these people are going crazy this   morning they handed them a new hampshire   new hampshire ollie Trump is leading in   no after that you think she wants me to   win you think when they do that they   hander uh oh in other words basically   saying oh this is bad news now he's   leading in New Hampshire will eat it in   New Hampshire we're leading in a great   state of Ohio will eating in a great   state that I just left Iowa   I think we're leading in North Carolina   I think we're going to win Pennsylvania   I think we're leading in Florida you   remember a week ago before it all   started they were saying I was watching   us a rule that's bad news they said   Texas is in play you know I'm not   supposed to lose Texas huh and I've been   there and I had the biggest rallies   you've ever seen 25 30 35 thousand   people lines that go for a mile long to   get it so I here two weeks ago Jim Texas   is employed Donald Trump is in serious   trouble I said Texas then two days ago a   man gets on television big cowboy hat   great guy Sid Miller's names and he said   I don't know what you people are talking   about but we have the longest lines   going into the voters boost that we've   ever had in the history of the state of   Texas and there are a lot of Trump apps   and drunk buttons and rump sure and it   turns out that we're doing records in   Texas these are bad people these are   lying people these are people that rig   the system the media they rigged the   system they are bad a bad people but   we're doing really well we're going to   have some surprise on Tuesday oh boy   that's going to be called brexit plus   ratchet   and you notice she's now you know she   was going to end her campaign go

North Carolina   she's not gonna be able to make it but   these are minor key they haven't played   but you know what all of a sudden   they're saying that they know better   than anybody this is a whole different   ballgame they don't know about us folks   they don't know about us we know how to   win we know how to win they don't know   how to win where the movement of the   future there's never been anything like   this in the history of our country   pundits have said it's a single greatest   political phenomena in their lifetime   and I couldn't say it unless they were   true because you know what they do   Donald Trump lie today they all say   there have never been crowds Bernie   Sanders had a tiny peanut compared to   what we've done and we're going to get a   lot of Bernie Sanders people because he   was right about one thing trade our   country is being ripped off on tray and   those people are coming to us you watch   and he should have never sold his soul   to the devil he should have never made   that deal   if he wouldn't have made that deal he   would have gone down as a great   political future right now he has   rallies and nobody even comes we are   fighting for every parent who lost their   child to drugs and crime and gang   violence we are fighting for every   community whose jobs and dreams have   been ripped out and shipped to other   countries we are fighting for every   American who believes government should   serve the people not the donors and not   the special   I'm asking you to dream big because with   your vote in just two days can you   believe it this started in june june   sixteenth of last year they said well   he's a smart person but he's got no   experience I've been dealing in politics   all my life by the way I supported all   these people for years he's got no   experience and then one by one by one by   one and one very smart guy one top   political person they were sitting   around a table smiling about Trump   joining the race and is one person who I   won't name but maybe I will sometimes he   SAT around the table and they're all   having a good time about us us too   forgotten people will call right the   forgotten people people that are so   great but the forgotten man forgotten   women they forgot but he's sitting   around a table and they're all smiling   have a good time he said I know him be   careful what you wish for just be   careful and then one by one by one it   was so much fun and not most of them and   they're good people and they're capable   people governor's senators   really fantastic people some fantastic   people most of whom endorsed me dr. ben   Carson a great guy Mike Huckabee a great   guy   many mouths almost all of them have   endorsed us but one by one by one and   now we have one flawed candidate left   and we're going to take it and we're   going to be so it's going to be the big   it's going to be so and you know what   it's again it's not for me we

 lengthen our military and take care of   our vets this is a movement trucks this   is not like even maybe about me isn't   that common sense it's about doing the   right thing   [Music]   I   Oh   [Music]   thank you very much   this is their record crowd I want to   thank the great owner of this hotel and   his incredible wife she's an incredible   woman sheldon adelson and really   incredible people and they've been so   supportive and we appreciate it we   appreciate it very much and Phil Ruffin   one of our great supporters is here   tonight Phil we love Phil and we're   doing great in the polls were winning   many national polls and we're ahead in   many states including your great state   and North Carolina and Ohio when Florida   in Iowa and so many others and just so   you know these polls came out yesterday   and today this was before the blow up on   Friday these polls are from before the   blow up so we'll see where the cusp of a   really incredible historic change that   transfers power from a failed political   establishment and returns that power to   our families communities and citizens in   nine days we are going to win the state   of Nevada no bad   the state of Nevada right you know I   don't know if you know but everybody in   New York says it the other way and I did   that once and I never will do it again   believe but we're gonna win the state of   Nevada and we're going to win back the   White House early voting is underway so   make sure you get to the pulse who's   voted that's like fifty percent if   anybody wants to leave right now go   ahead I won't be insulted there's plenty   of people outside that want to take your   place okay now make sure you vote   because otherwise this incredible   movement that we've created together we   won't get there and that will be very   very bad for all of us it would be very   bad for the country a trump   administration will immediately repeal   and replace Obamacare   it's just been announced that the   citizens of Nevada are going to   experience a massive massive in fact I   don't want to tell you what the number   is I won't because I'll you'll walk out   of here depressed double-digit hike in   there Obama care premiums for the year   ten of Nevada 16 counties will have only   Obamacare and think of it you can have   one exchange in sure to choose from they   are in a very good position to negotiate   with you aren't they not with Trump   we're going to get rid of it and we're   going to have health care that is so   good and so much less expensive because   Obamacare forgetting about the cost   which is ridiculous it's no good it   doesn't work and your deductibles and so   high you're never going to be able to   use it so Obamacare is a catastrophe for   your state in Minnesota with a premium   increase will be close to sixty percent   the Democratic governor has just said   the Affordable Care Act is no longer   affordable Hillary Clinton wants to   double down on Obamacare making it even   more expensive in fact much more   expensive   my contract with the American voter   outlines a plan to repeal and replace   Obamacare and I'm asking for your vote   so we can save health care for every   family in your state and in this country   will change also means getting rid of   the corruption in Washington you've been   seeing a little corruption right you   could see system is rigged it's rigged   little corruption you've been watching   as you've heard it was just announced on   Friday that the FBI is reopening their   investigation into the criminal and   illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton   Hillary has nobody but herself to blame   for her mounting legal problems her   criminal action was willful deliberate   intentional and purposeful Hillary set   up an illegal server for the obvious   purpose of shielding her criminal   conduct from public disclosure and   exposure she set up this illegal server   knowing full well that her actions put   our national security at risk and put   the safety and security of your children   at risk to cover up her crimes she   bleached and deleted 33,000 emails after   receiving a congressional subpoena   after after after after she gets a   subpoena and she deletes and bleaches   and nobody even ever heard of bleaching   did anybody ever hear bleaching you know   why it's such an expensive process but   it makes him go away but have a feeling   they've just found a lot of them don't   you think have a phone   puma   they just found a lot of them we never   thought we were going to say thank you   to Anthony Weiner   [Applause]   she made 13 phones disappear some with a   hammer she lied to Congress under oath   she lied to the FBI many times and then   two boxes of email evidence just   recently went mysteriously missing then   you have the WikiLeaks revelations which   have exposed criminal corruption at the   highest levels of our government Hillary   put the office of Secretary of State up   for sale and if she ever did get the   chance which we're not gonna let her   have she'd put the Oval Office up for   sale also you have no doubt about that   yet now it's reported that the   Department of Justice is fighting the   FBI that's because the Department of   Justice is trying so hard to protect   Hillary Clinton   they didn't try to protect our generals   they didn't try to protect a lot of   other people how can the Attorney   General be involved in this case or tell   the FBI what to do when the Attorney   General violated sanctity of law by   secretly meeting with Bill Clinton the   husband of the possible target of the   investigation and a possible target   himself in an airplane on the tarmac in   Arizona   remember he was gonna play golf remember   but he just happened to be at the   airport hanging around and the Attorney   General's playing drove by right and   he's old isn't that up oh yes oh gee   let's say hello let's say hello just it   was a chance meeting they said right   well the meeting lasted 39 minutes and   they supposedly talked about golf and   grandchildren so I give two minutes to   golf I give five minutes to   grandchildren but what they probably   really talked about was the Attorney   General's reappointment should Hillary   Clinton become president which I don't   think is going to happen because of this   highly inappropriate meeting at best the   Attorney General took herself   essentially out of the case and put   director Comey in charge of making   decisions you saw that decision-making   process so why is she now allowed to   fight so hard to get someone who is so   obviously guilty on so many different   fronts off the hook in fact it was   publicly reported that sources close to   Hillary Clinton said and she actually I   think said it to the papers that she was   thinking of reappointing attorney   general Lynch   she was thinking she said it I mean it   was a statement she made and effectively   I guess you'd call that a bribe wouldn't   you wouldn't it could bribe how could   she say they're gonna make a decision on   her and you're talking about you're   gonna reappoint she said it publicly I   believe when I heard it I found it a   little bit hard to believe that she'd   say that this is what we mean when we   say the system is rigged trick what   makes us exceptional is that we are a   nation of laws and that we are all equal   under those laws Hillary's corruption   shreds the principles on which our   nation was founded when the powerful can   get away with anything because they have   the money and the connections to rig the   system then the people lose hope and   confidence in the future of their   country corruption is corrosive to the   soul of a democracy and it must be   stopped or we're gonna stop   [Applause]   because we have one ultimate check on   Hillary's corruption and that is the   power of the vote the power of the world   the only way to beat the corruption is   to show up and vote by the tens of   millions including millions of people   voting for the first time in their lives   [Applause]   there was a great guy on television that   I have to tell you about it his name was   Sid Miller from Texas oh they know Sid   Miller we created yet another star but   he was on this morning he was on Fox and   a lot of you saw him and he said you   know these New Yorkers have it all wrong   you guys have it all wrong he's from   Texas you're wearing a big white hat   smart guy he said you know in Texas I   kept reading where we're even and I said   wow I don't think so because I see the   enthusiasm but the voting started he   said I gotta tell you we have more   people voting now that we've ever had   ever in an election they're all coming   from all over there people we've never   seen before they've never voted before   or they haven't voted for 20 years and   they're all voting for Trump and when   they say then he said and when I listen   to these guys talking and I know every   one of them because these are the most   honest I tell you what these are the   most dishonest human beings right back   [Applause]   for instance when we tell them to turn   the cameras to show this incredible   record crowd record for this ballroom   this is the record for this ballroom   Sheldon told me that himself   record   they don't show it you're wasting your   time they don't show it because they're   dishonest because they don't want to   show the crowds that we get the biggest   ever in the history of this country   there's never been a movement like this   and they don't want to show it and we're   going to go into it in a couple of   seconds but they are very dishonest the   media is very very dishonest show the   crowd why don't you show the crowd   turned the cameras   they'll get up a couple of them get up   they say Donald Trump spoke today before   a small crowd it's disgusting the other   day a man got up we had 17,000 people he   said Donald Trump spoke in front of a   few thousand people well few to me means   three I don't know that's the way I grew   up when I hear a few thousand people   that sort of means to me like three   anyway very very dishonest people but   Sid Miller said we've never had anything   like this it's fifty percent higher than   it has ever been before in Texas and he   said we're going to win and he wasn't   for me he said Trump is going to win by   massive numbers bigger than anyone's   ever seen   and he said so I don't know what you   people are talking about on television   where they're saying the vote in Texas   is going to be very close he said I   don't know what you people are talking   about you must be talking about a   different Texas of the one I'm from so   we love the people in Texas and I know   whats going and you know what else the   same thing is happening in Florida the   same things happening in North Carolina   is happening all over because people are   sick and tired of stupidity and deals   and look at around look at the Iran deal   they're sick and tired of the Iran deal   they don't want to be giving Iran 1.7   billion in cash be from here up to the   ceiling they don't want to remember   three weeks ago they had 800 people that   were they were getting ready to deport   right you saw this right they had them   that they were tough anybody that gets   deported from this country believe me   they have to be tough so they have 800   little mistake instead of deporting them   they all became United States citizens   and I'll tell you that's not the worst   of it the worst of it wasn't 800 people   it was 1800 people okay so   congratulations you have some wonderful   new citizens of this country and then   what is it that's okay fix the problem   that's okay fix it they said that   wouldn't be constitutional give me a   break all right so we're stuck 1.7   billion in cash to Iran can you believe   can you imagine their eyes when they saw   that money being brought in by truck can   you imagine did you ever see what a   million dollars looks like in cash it's   a lot of that's a lot of money 1.7   billion in cash and then what do they do   they grab our sailors are 10 sailors   destroy their lives humiliate those   people instead of saying hey listen you   were in our waters you got to get over a   little bit they humiliate the sailors   they humiliate our country and they   would have kept them except they're 150   billion dollar payment started the next   day okay stupid they're not and people   are tired of it we're tired was sick and   tired of it and don't forget I was on   the other side for a long time folks I   understand that side very well and it's   a good life but I love this country I   love the people of this country and   we're going to change it we're going to   change we're gonna we're gonna do it   right   so go out and vote with all your heart   and soul and we're going to make America   great again that i can tell you okay   [Applause]   restoring honesty to our government and   the rule of law to our society will be   one of my truly highest priorities now   we have a lot we have to rebuild our   military we have to create borders we   have to do so much but that's going to   be right up there my contract with the   American voter begins with a plan to end   government corruption I want the entire   corrupt Washington establishment to hear   and heed the words that we all not me we   have to say when we win on November rain   we are going to Washington DC and we are   going to drain the swamp   true   you know I told people the other day   drain the swamp i said i don't really   like that expression this was two weeks   ago i said i don't love that expression   so hokey I thought it was hokey I said   you know and all of a sudden I I said oh   I hate to use this it's sort of like it   doesn't work correct and I said it two   weeks ago to a big crowd and I said it   and the place went crazy then I said it   a second time and the place went even   crazier and then the third time like you   they started saying it before I said it   and all of a sudden I decided I love   that expression it's a great   crazy right drain this one   [Applause]   thank you you know a man who loved Las   Vegas was Frank Sinatra and he had as we   like Frank Sinatra Frank Sinatra he was   great and when he originally heard and   sang for the first time my way how do we   like my way yes but he didn't like it   but then he sang it a couple of times   and then it went to number one and all   of a sudden he loved it okay so he loved   that's the way it works you never know   at the core of my contract is my plan to   bring back our jobs right   [Applause]   right now 70 million American women and   children live in poverty or near the   brink of poverty forty-three percent of   african-american school-age children are   living in poverty thirty-four percent of   Hispanic school-age children live in   poverty this is unacceptable in our   country it's unacceptable in America as   your president I will go into the   poorest communities and work on a   national plan for revitalization we will   break decades of failure and prove that   real change is possible if we simply cut   our ties with the failed politicians and   politics of the past   America has lost one third of its   manufacturing jobs since bill clinton   signed nafta   and Hilary loved it America and this is   something that every time I say they   always because it sounds so crazy I   thought it was a typo I thought it was   700 factories or 7,000 maybe America has   lost seventy thousand factories since   China entered the World Trade   Organization another bill and hillary   back deal we're living through the   greatest jobs theft in the history of   our world what's happened to our jobs   it's the greatest jobs theft all because   our politicians are either incompetent   or they've gotten so much campaign   contributions or other things or other   things and the special interest you know   special interests like what's happening   but we're getting wiped out you go to   Michigan you go to I mean you go to New   England you look at areas around here   you look at what's happened it's a one   lane highway

said   unbelievable it's unbelievable we're in   the United States no not at all in   Mexico it's the seventh wonder of the   world so we've got it we've got to have   we got to change things folks a trump   administration will stop the horrible   horrible horrible trans-pacific   partnership we will renegotiate NAFTA   and we are going to stand up to China's   currency manipulation I have great   relationships with China but their   currency manipulation what they do to   our country is unbelievable we have a   trade balance think of this we have a   deficit trade deficit with China almost   500 billion dollars   here we all join a 1.5 trillion dollars   that's a good Act they come in they take   our jobs and make our product they make   a fortune and we owe them 1.5 trillions   good act but we'll get herself I have   great relations with China made a lot of   money with China the biggest bank in the   world is a tenant of mine in Manhattan   it's from China biggest bank in the   world by far not even close the condos I   own the bank of america building with a   great partner in San Francisco got it   through China through a certain very   complicated route we're going to

increase Syrian refugees pouring into   our country by five hundred and fifty   percent that's over Obama's number   that's over the thousands and thousands   that are already coming in through Obama   when I'm elected president we will   suspend the Syrian refugee program have   no choice and we will keep radical   Islamic terrorists the hell out of our   country believe me   but we're also going to work to build   safe havens over there and we're going   to get the Gulf states to pay for we   don't have to pay for it they have   plenty of money we're going to get the   Gulf states to pay for it and they will   pay for it and we have to help the   people but we just can't do this anymore   folks we have problems we don't need to   be the great the Great Trojan horse   modern day version great Trojan was not   going to be us a trump administration   will also secure and defend the borders   of the United States and yes we will   build a wall   [Applause]   Sheldon you have a great great hotel but   I tell you we could have made this   ballroom a little bit larger maybe could   have been at large this is some great   space and we also have by the way the   legendary Phil Ruffin of Las Vegas where   is Phil where is I get him over here   Keith he employs thousands of people and   he's a great guy Hilary has pledged open   borders and supports sanctuary cities   countless Americans are killed by   illegal immigrants because our   government refuses to do its job right   here in your state 20 year old Brian   coursing was shot and paralyzed by an   illegal immigrant he fought for his life   in the hospital for 17 days ultimately   he died Brian was a basketball star   loved by everybody with dreams of   becoming a firefighter right here on   Mother's Day in 2009 Carson City born   beautiful beautiful person just an   incredible person Renee Angelo was out   driving looking for a job when he was   shot in the head and murdered by a   previously deported illegal immigrant   gang member everybody said we must get   him out of our country we must   incarcerate him we must do something   this this guy was brutal Renee was   pulled from his vehicle and left to die   on the side of a road a Good Samaritan   who thought there had been a car   accident stopped to help and he was also   shot the illegal immigrant killer had a   previous conviction as an accessory to   murder in Carson City and he had a   record as long as your arm but the Obama   administration didn't want to put him   out   Josh Wilkerson whose mother I've gotten   to know during this campaign was   murdered at the age of 17 Josh a student   in a high school and a good student was   tortured strangled and beaten to death   by the illegal immigrant and then his   body was set on fire and there are so   there are so many of these stories when   I become president this crime wave will   end and it will end very very quickly   [Applause]   we will end illegal immigration we will   deport all criminal illegal immigrants   you have a lot of people that are   walking around and it the great thing   our local police they know who they are   they know I'm better than they know   their own family and we will get them   out now when Hilary brought him out   they'd bring him back to their country   and the country very intelligently   wouldn't take him right and so would   bring him back would release him into   our society she would always let him   come back she didn't want to make waves   that will never ever happen once not   once with me we were also so important   and by the way the Border Patrol agents   of this country and ice both of them   they've never endorsed a candidate for   president before both groups every one   of them both groups endorsed Donald   Trump what happens we will also repeal   the obama-clinton defense seek Western   rebuild are badly depleted military with   the greatest people in the world but we   need help we have the endorsements of   over 200 Admirals and generals and 22   medal of honor recipients and I want to   thank general Flynn for being a great   guy great man our Air Force is the   smallest and oldest in its history and   my plan calls for building new fighter   jets oh you know what this is Nellis   Nellis Air Force Coast you can have nice   do plan   Nellis Air Force Base did you ever see   where our fighter jets are so old that   we can't get parts anymore for these are   planes and services so old we can't get   parts that's going to change the enemy   has better planes than us and they buy   them from us or they take them we also   need a new foreign policy that puts   America first again America first   Hillary and our failed Washington   establishment have spent six trillion   dollars on wars in the Middle East and   now it's in worse shape I mean think of   it all of that money all of those lives   and it's in far worse shape than it ever   has been by a factor of 10 they've   dragged us into foreign wars they've   made us less safe and these awards that   they never win we don't win we don't win   it anything we don't win a trade we   don't win a Wars they've left our   borders wide open at home and they've   shipped our jobs and wealth to other   countries to all Americans I say it is   now time for real leadership we're going   to have real leadership   [Applause]   so sad so sale thank you thank you   and closing just think about what we can   accomplish in the first 100 days of a   trumpet administration we're going to   have the biggest tax cut since Ronald   Reagan we will eliminate every   unnecessary job-killing regulation we   will cancel every illegal Obama   executive order and by the way Hillary   Clinton just in case you don't know it   you do know

must ensure   is the next president of the United   States of America Donald Trump   [Applause]   thank you everybody Your Honor this is a   great honor great state I have a lot of   property a lot people in Virginia pay a   lot of checks being every night every   day a lot of great success I've had in   Virginia over the years and we have just   phenomenal stuff in Loudoun County as   you know and we have down in   Charlottesville some other stuff the   tremendous tremendous beautiful property   Charlottesville's right next to Thomas   Jefferson it was an architect you know   he had great taste he had great taste he   understood that some of the most   beautiful land I've ever seen so I love   Virginia and we are going to win   Virginia we're gonna win   I'm going to go over some of the   statistics when Tim Kaine was governor   than not pretty they're not pretty but   before I do I just want to say that   debbie Wasserman Schultz   I always knew she was highly overrated   Haley oh not good but she just got fired   I said Debbie you're fired get out there   be out boom boy they were how about that   for disloyalty though in terms of   Hillary Clinton in all fairness because   debbie Wasserman Schultz has been so   much for Hillary Clinton and as for it   just why these politicians folks other   than Mike Pence of course he's great but   these politicians hiller luck luck so   there's no loyalty there right there's   no loyalty none whatsoever it gets a   little heat and they fire her get out of   here get out of here first she knew what   was going on Hillary Clinton knew what   was going on she knew everything that   was going on she knew it's a rigged   system that Bernie Sanders never had a   chance okay he never had a chance and if   you look at it look what's going on   they're having a lot of people marching   now a lot of those people that are vote   for us I'll tell you right now a lot of   [Applause]   and not even because they like me or   they don't like me although I have to   see have you seen the polls that just   came out from right we had like the   biggest bounce that anyone can remember   they said well if he gets out of the   convention with no bounce that will be a   success do we have nine points or   something pennpoint we're leaving we're   actually leading in the polls   and the CNN poll was so good I may have   to start liking them again but I don't   no they treat me unfairly but you know   what's more important to poll but you   know the big ball the big pole let's   november eight that support we care   about but look how disloyal kruky and   hillary clinton was to somebody that put   her life on the line I mean she what she   did in order to take advantage of Bernie   Sanders in all of the supporters debbie   Wasserman what she did in order to make   sure that the system the rigged system   stays intact and hillary gets it and   then you see the emails can you imagine   they talk about religion they talk about   religion can you imagine if that was my   ID right now be on the front page of   every newspaper would be horrible and   they're trying to play it down well that   wasn't so bad that wasn't so bad no but   could you imagine there's such a   different standard so here's the story   it's a story so Debbie was totally loyal   to Hillary and Hillary threw her under a   bus and it didn't take her more than   five minutes to make that decision man I   don't want her covering my back I'll   tell you right now screw it's true   now the other thing I'm surprised at you   know it's nice when you're not reading   speeches isn't it really because I can   talk about current events this stuff   happened 10 minutes ago you know if   you're reading speeches I see these guys   I dealt with a lot of them I've actually   been a very political person on my life   I've always been on the other side but   now for 14 months I've been doing this   and I like this side in a certain way   better because we can do things better   they used to love me when I was just to   contribute I'd give millions of dollars   just I was a contributing now I know we   know I like this better i like i like   being non-establishment better but with   Bernie when you look at what happened   the thing that surprises me most is how   we folded he folded I thought he was   really hanging out tough tough tough   then they find these horrible emails   talking about his religion and dizzy   Jewish and is he an atheist and one and   that's not going to play well and sir   man that's rough and that's not as bad   as some of the other ones and I said   there's no way that Bernie Sanders shows   up to make a speech there's no way that   he can ever endorse crooked Hillary   Clinton anymore right there's no way and   today I see him trying to make the case   and his own people are out there booing   okay they're out there boy so it's   pretty bad then I'll tell you Hillary   Clinton I've been saying this for a long   time and I got it from Bernie Sanders   cuz he said she suffers from bad   judgment right bad judgment she suffers   from very bad judgment her instincts are   bad they're no good her instincts are   defective her instincts are defective   but she's got she's low energy she   actually is long   she'll go home she'll take a nap for   four or five hours and she'll come back   no naps for Trump no now I don't take   that we don't have time we don't have   tongue you ever see Hillary where she   comes out and she'll read a teleprompter   for a little while ninja communal 0 for   3 4 days then she comes back and then   they used to I remember and I with it   put like three or four people really   nice people in there sitting around a   little table and everyone saying well   I'd like to ask you a question no no no   you're too tough this is what we have   how do you think Isis is going to relax   yeah I don't think so right I don't   think so not going to be good now we   have tough enemies out there we have   tough mean vicious horrible horrible   people these are horrible horrible human   beings we need toughness folks it's   about time we need strength we need   toughness we need smarts we need warmth   we need compassion we need everything we   need everything but we don't need   somebody that goes home and take snaps   we don't need naps but what did surprise   me was that Bernie was so soft on us I   really i was amazed because i watch the   speech you know we must vote for Hillary   Clinton I mean the hatred he's got but   why would he do that he looks better if   he didn't do it to me hey what do I have   to do with it I don't care whatever he   wants to do but could you imagine if   what's taking place now with the   Democrats took place in Cleveland and by   the way I have to tell you Cleveland did   an amazing job Thank You Ohio Thank You   Cleveland what a job   I spoke to the police chief Calvin did a   phenomenal job up there but what we had   and the Secret Service working with the   Secret Service what a job they did but   Cleveland's a beautiful place i mean   really i was so happy we had no problems   they were trying to show i know they   showed this one square where's this big   square in that a few people they bring   the cameras in close you know really   because they don't want to show all that   beautiful grass you know with no people   on and and you know why I'll tell you   why because people like our message   people like our message they really like   it and if you look at Philadelphia I   went to school in Philadelphia I love   Philadelphia if you look at Philadelphia   what they're going through right now   looks like a lot of people it's a   hundred degrees in and speaking of that   by the way I don't know if you sir did   you know I went to the other room so you   have a second room and then outside you   have over a thousand people and it's a   hundred and four degrees out don't think   of it and it's the first time I ever did   it I said let's go let's go to the   second room first right that's the ante   room but let's go cuz that's the   overflow room I said so I went in there   we surprised them we were nice but you   know I will love these people but you   know what i also like it ought to do it   later   and outside we have a lot of people and   I wish said let them in the fire   department won't let them in because of   a fire regulation which is very sad   because they're outside it's we have   speakers out there I think the speakers   are burning up folks it is hot i wish   the fire marshal where's the fire   marshal is he around it come on fire   mark if they could get in fire marshal   you know you have doors that go right   out to the outside I promise there's   nothing like you don't have a problem I   feel badly we have those people we have   people standing outside you could get a   few more people inside if they could let   him in so that's the way a builder would   talk okay that's the way of building so   you had the firing of the head of the   DNC and that was a vicious firing a lot   of things happen you had her firing   Hillary Clinton's total disloyalty was   at play it really was people don't say   that they won't say that on the media oh   if I did something with rights can you   imagine if I fired rights I wouldn't do   that because rights has done such a   great job rights previous what a job he   has done and I always used to say for   months now I've been saying I'll take   rights over Debbie and everyone said oh   but Debbie's a superstar said so his   rights and then it turned out that   Debbie flamed out and she's gone but the   disloyalty was incredible and I really   mean that because honestly whether you   like her or not she worked very hard to   rig the system so that Hillary got it's   true right it's true no it's true she   worked very very hard to rig the system   little did she know that China Russia   one of our many many friends came in and   hacked the hell out of us can you   imagine   can you imagine what they're hacking I   guarantee we'll find the 33,000 emails   [Applause]   why did Hillary get rid of her middle   name huh Hillary no but why did she get   rid of it Hillary rotten clin rotten   clean Hilary rotten Clinton right maybe   that's why it's too close no no it's too   close it's too close you think Mike   Pence would say this I don't think so by   the way did I do a good job with mike   pence okay him and his family what a   high quality person you know you have to   vet people right and we vetted Mike and   they came back to these are killers they   came back with many pages on certain   people okay many pages I oh I'd like to   read a book many many pages with Mike   they came back with like nothing he's   like the most perfect human being this   guy I said Mike did you ever do anything   wrong in your whole life no I don't   think so he is where is he's the best   guy that guy is correct I love this guy   I love him I love it but you know what I   really like about Mike so listen to this   to me a very important thing is her bad   judgment now whether you like her choice   Tim Kaine nobody even knows who he is no   he's done a terrible job for Virginia I   assumed they said all he picked her you   know he got picked because of Virginia's   Virginia is very important and I'm doing   very well here hey hey I'm employing a   lot of people here and they don't employ   anybody I spent a lot of money in   Potomac Falls sterling that area I mean   I spent a lot of money we have great   great things happening next year we have   two senior pga championship coming   thousands and thousands of people come   into Virginia and spend a lot of money   thank you i love you too doh but but   just think of it so Hillary Clinton has   almost a fifty percent of the people   want a progressive okay we don't have to   like that but that's okay that's where   they are   they want to give everything away and   raise your taxes that's what happens no   no she will have a tax raise by the way   I have the largest tax cut of anybody   running for office Republican or   Democrat okay but Hillary Clinton   Hillary Clinton will have a tax cut that   is not there it's going to be a tax cut   x 20 in Reverse like a rocket ship we   have the biggest tax cut proposed I   guess it'll last for years and it's   we're going to get it through at least   we're going to get most of it through   i'll tell you what up and try and get   all of it through but we have and its   policy it's you know put out there that   doesn't mean there's not a little   negotiation because we're going to have   to negotiate but we're going to have it   go hillary clinton's going to have one   of the biggest tax increases in the   history of our country because what   she's proposing you're going to have to   pay for a very simple very simple now   maybe she'll you know after she gets her   to Bernie get rid of all this stuff   doesn't help you by the way but what   she's proposing she needs to have a   massive massive tax increase now nobody   ever talks about that do you notice she   never talks about who's going to pay for   it now they're going to pay but just   statistically she's going to need a very   major tax cut but here's something to me   that's very interesting fifty percent of   that party is Bernie Sanders almost and   they're very passion and that's a much   more passionate side her people they   fall asleep okay they fall asleep there   watching her with Bernie's people   they're really out there they say what   you want about Bernie Sanders he got it   on free trade he got it free trade now   I'm totally I'm a free trader I believe   in free trade you know they get it all   wrong because they just don't say it   properly but I want smotret I want I   want to trade with other countries but I   don't want to lose 500 billion dollars   here with China Thank You China we love   you very much but we're not going to   lose 500 billion dollars and I don't   want to have a trade imbalance with   Japan where they send us millions of   cars and we send them some beef and then   they send it back right and then they we   send some wheat wheat they send cars we   send wheat sounds like we got to send a   lot of wheat right   the trader balance is massive and with   Mexico we have an unbelievably big trade   amount so they kill us at the border   they kill us they're killing us at the   border and we have one of the biggest   trade imbalances and what happens what   happens I'm not even including the drugs   right the drugs are pouring across you   know I won the state of New Hampshire   and I got very very friendly with the   people in New Hampshire I'll never   forget them because that's an amazing   group of people and I said what's your   biggest problem they said heroin pouring   across the southern border I said heroin   New Hampshire because you look at new   hampshire so beautiful with the lakes   and the little beautiful roads and the   trees and the forests I say you don't   heron I said you have he said mr. Trump   you have no idea it's one of the worst   areas for that it comes pouring across   the southern what I said you know what   if I win I'm gonna sit I'm going to fix   that problem well i am going to fix that   problem i'm gonna fix that problem and   one of the ways i appreciate that you   know i always like to say if I went   because honestly life is a very strange   thing and things and I don't want to be   arrogant because I don't want to be   accused by them of being arrogant so   I'll say if but it better be when or I'm   going to be very angry at you folks from   Virginia from Virginia but the folks in   New Hampshire and you're having the same   problems but they're having it for   whatever reason disproportionately badly   heroin is pouring across the border and   it's going a lot of it's going all over   the country by the way everybody's got   the problem you buy it for less than a   candy bar and our youth is being   poisoned and plenty of other people but   our youth is being poisoned by this   stuff heroin heroin and what we're going   to do thank you and what we're going to   do is first of all the border patrol   agents endorse me 16,500 they've never   done that   and their job is easier now without   Trump their job is easier without Trump   because you know right now they just end   and people go by and these are great   people I got to know him very well the   border patrol agents want to do their   job it's a much tougher job probably a   much more dangerous job would you stop   people and say sorry folks boom go back   but that's more dangerous and saying you   know we can't do anything it's called   stand back stand back and leave Milan   let them walk right in how stupid are we   how stupid are we okay so I spoke to   them when they endorse me and I said so   let me ask you a wall how important they   said mr. Trump it's very very important   very film and they know they know see I   just saved a million dollars somebody   else would go out and hire a consultant   who knows nothing they come in from   Harvard they'd spend about a year at the   border they learn nothing they then   write this 2,000 page report that nobody   will read they'll charge you 1 million   dollars for the report and you have no   idea what just happened as opposed to   saying like I did with the Border Patrol   is a wall good they said very good they   actually is an interesting expression   they said it's a vital tool to turn   things around it was a very interesting   expression they didn't say great bet   they just said it's a vital tool mr.   Trump to turn things around especially   the drug traffic because it's very tough   and we can build that wall so easily and   by the way Mexico is gonna pay for the   wall you know just just because   they're gonna pay for the way and I got   great we got great marks on the on the   speech the other night and everyone did   everybody did so great we had such that   by the way after seven the Republican   National Convention was such a   tremendous success it was so great I   mean we had a couple of people that I   think probably destroyed their careers   but who knows but but honestly though   but honestly that was such an incredible   success and look at what's going on in   Philadelphia that was such a beautiful   deal the city of Cleveland was great the   law enforcement was unbelievable we had   no riots we had no nothing it was   unbelievable I'll never forget it as   long as I live it was unbelievable and   [Applause]   and I made a speech and i have to tell   you because i figured this would not   because i could if i made a speech if I   if I gave the Gettysburg Address as   given as good as anybody could possibly   I figured you know you always get Nicky   always get not I got great reviews on   this Beach I got great reviews we got   standing ovations some people said well   the speech was a little long that's   because we had 26 or 27 minutes of like   standing ovations we had applause and I   had a great time doing it because I'm   talking about something that I love   we're in a movement folks this is a   movement this isn't just I love what   we're doing together right i love i love   what we're doing together i love it and   what really what i have to say is this   so Hillary Clinton is bad judgment she   shouldn't have picked this guy big   mistake because he's the exact opposite   what all of the Bernie people want now   if he got two percent of the vote or   five percent of the vote or twenty   percent of the vote she's but you know   what he almost beat her if the system   wasn't gamed if the system wasn't gamed   he would have been her he would have   beaten her now now think of this so   instead of picking somebody and you   don't have to go with Pocahontas you   to go that far who by the way who hasn't   done anything she's the worst she is the   worst senator at the US Senate you know   she's got a fresh mouth other bet she's   got nothing going she has got she has   done nothing in the US Senate but you   don't have to pick her but you could   have picked a liberal person and we   understand it where we can live with it   and you know she could have had part of   unity instead they have thousands and   thousands of people going crazy because   she didn't pick somebody representative   she didn't pick somebody representative   what's going on let's let's go look   again she's got bad judgment whether   it's Libya whether it's Benghazi whether   it's at night with the calls with the   calls everybody's calling the only cold   she answers is her friend calls she   picks that one up but she doesn't pick   up the calls to help she's got bad   judgment Bernie Sanders said she's got   bad judgment she's got bad judgment when   it came to picking a vice presidential   candidate for that side of the party   [Applause]   I actually just ask Mike Pence I said   Mike do you think she's going to be   forced to change because honestly now I   wouldn't pick him I wouldn't pick him   for a different reason though you know   why I wouldn't pick him so Mike Pence at   Indiana has done an unbelievable job a   triple a bond rating so many different   things job creation top and virtually   every category right toward the top at   the top listen to this during tim   kaine's tenure as governor of virginia   plus he's not very popular I thought   that I would see Paul saying is at   eighty-five percent and Trump is going   to lose Virginia I'm gonna people don't   even like the guy and he lay in a little   weed weird little dude there I don't   know what's going on with him during tim   kaine's 10 years governor of Virginia   from 2006 to 2010 the unemployment rate   of the state more than doubled so I   immediately went back to my statistician   I said listen do me a favor will you   please check it came back he said hey   maybe he's wrong but more than double   this is your great governor right now   Governor Mike Pence cut unemployment   rate from 8.4 percent to less than five   percent quickly   [Applause]   since 2013 Indiana's gone from 31st in   the nation for veterans unemployment to   second and it's going to go to first   okay veterans unemployment during Tim   Kaine that's the guy that bad judgment   crooked Hillary Clinton bad judgment   such manager we can't have another   president with bad judgment we can't do   it during tim kaine's 10 years governor   the state of Virginia lost sixty   thousand manufacturing jobs now Indiana   gained thirty thousand now it's a   different time and different everything   he was you know so I'm not comparing   than not because you'll say well one was   here was that but I'll tell you if mike   pence or me was running virginia we do   great this guy did a lousy job you know   why is the political hack that's why   he's a political hack look what he's   done look what he's done he's always   been in politics he likes politics he   wants to be in politics always okay   during Tim Kaine seniors governor   virginia it averaged almost no gdp   growth and indiana as you know is doing   great I mean think of it here's a beauty   okay nobody is going to vote for Tim   Kaine when you hear this one okay Tim   king I never I never even heard of this   guy but that's okay less than a week   after Tim Kaine became governor of   Virginia one week he proposed a nearly   four billion dollar tax increase four   billion   including a tax increase on people   earning as little as seventeen thousand   dollars a year he tried to pass a   transportation reform he failed whereas   Mike Pence had tremendous look I mean   the whole thing is ridiculous so a four   billion dollar tax increases first week   do we want this as a present now you   know look hopefully we don't have to   worry about it I will say this Virginia   has lost one in three manufacturing jobs   since bill clinton ease of my   statisticians a great signed the   agreement to put china into the World   Trade Organization don't forget he did   that but bill clinton signed something   that was the worst trade bill ever the   history of this country okay in the   history of this country nafta that was   built and people don't realize i'll tell   you a little joke see how hot it is   everyone everyone's sweating and soaking   wet right here's the difference i   wouldn't pay the hotel bill i'd say we   are in a hotel we're in a ballroom and   you know what now these are grown   companies we're in a ballroom and if   we're at a ballroom it's not supposed to   be so hot that everybody in the audience   is using as a fan so what they do is   they turn the air conditioning down   because they saved money so then i would   not pay them and you know what i do i   pay my bills so fast with somebody good   with somebody average i pay him okay   with somebody great a lot of times i   give bonuses but here we are in a   ballroom and I'm like I feel like I'm in   a sauna okay right   right so I don't know what hotel this is   but you ought to try turning on the air   conditioning oh we're not gonna get your   pain this paper is it am i right hot   just so you know I'm really good at this   business you make a lot more money if   you own a hotel and you let people   suffer and don't turn on air   conditioning you make a lot more money   you would be surprised at how much it   cause but this is ridiculous and so then   there'll be an article Donald Trump   refuses to pay the bill course and you   know what the smart people say Trump is   smart the other people would say oh   isn't that terrible okay i think the   ballroom and the people that own this   hotel should be ashamed of themselves   right so look look so Virginia lost one   and three manufacturing jobs since the   bill clinton bill Hillary supported   China's entry into WTO roanoke which is   a beautiful place by the way has lost   one and I've been here many times as   long as one in three manufacturing jobs   okay since the Clinton disasters last   year the US trade deficit with TPP   countries I mean I could go into this I   could read this stuff to you gets a   little boring after all but it's all the   same thing we have Hillary Clinton   wanted to approve TPP that's   trans-pacific partnership and then I   announce that I'm against it and then   she heard me making his peace this is   what I've heard a friend of mine told me   and I basically said the various reasons   including monetary manipulation currency   manipulation etc why it's so good why it   will be another NAFTA but maybe even   worse can't be worse but it'll be as bad   okay different countries but it'll be   his bed and she heard me and she said oh   he'll kill me in the debate so what   happened is she all of a sudden came out   against TPP but as soon as you're   sitting there she's going to approve TPP   if she won she will approve it she'll   make a change she'll make a commis   you'll say move that come oh now I can   do it okay folks 6,000 pages of material   that most people haven't read   it is a disaster trans-pacific   partnership is a disaster you can't let   it happen we will never let it happen I   will never ever let it happen and I   don't want to make deals with many   countries I want to do one-on-one deals   one-on-one you got to see this deal it's   like a fancy jigsaw puzzle lines going   here here there so if one of the country   miss behaves you can't do anything cuz   you sort of locked up into this very   complex agreement and believe me it's   just like Obamacare thousands of pages   and nobody in Congress read it and now   it's a disaster and we will repeal it   and replace it with something fabulous   okay all right   but but we're going to have something   that's going to be very special and I   have to tell you I appreciate your being   here and I really wish I appreciate it   thank you thank you thank you thank you   and I appreciate the folks in the room   next door which is almost as big as this   and it's packed also and even more than   you folks I appreciate the people   standing outside at 104 they're dying   there dying although I venture to say   that they're more comfortable than I am   right now it's probably I think it's   actually cooler outside than it is in   this damn ballroom ridiculous   predictors   [Applause]   but you know what I'll tell you know   what I love look at this room its back   you know what I love and the other rooms   pack what I love nobody left not one   person I always watch the doors if i   seed or Saudi to open people pouring out   I usually stop but that never happens   with me never ever but but I stop nobody   lives because you know what we're in   this together we're in this together   this is a movement so Time magazine just   did another cover I talked about it you   saw the one from the back of my head   right it's pretty full back there you   know could be could be better could be   better but not bad but a picture from   the back of my head the guy was standing   right off of me with a camera like this   I studied that picture very close I   didn't read the story but i did study   the picture of her no I think that's   number five or six that we've had so I   think I've had two in my lifetime and   five or six in the last few months where   you know we had this incredible thing   going on and they call it a movement and   Bill O'Reilly calls in a moment he's   never seen anything like he said in his   professional career in his whole life   time he actually said this is the single   greatest political phenomena that is   ever witness and brit unison and a lot   of people   [Applause]   and I really mean this it's not about me   it's about you there's there I'm a   messenger there's a group of people in   this country that's massive you know   they used to call it a silent majority I   don't use the term it's a noisy majority   because we've had it we've had it with   the Iran deal we've had it with our   depleted military we've had it with no   borders we've had it with education   where we're ranked right near the bottom   we're doing horribly we've had it where   they want to essentially abolish your   second Amendment you have no protection   for yourself we've had and by the way   the NRA endorsed me and they're great   people one hundred percent and the   evangelicals how many evangelicals do we   have in here you better get out and vote   because you didn't vote for Romney and   you better get out and vote for me you   know we have the Johnson amendment where   Lyndon Johnson who is very powerful put   an amendment we're basically our pastors   or ministers and all religions they   don't have the right to speak up then I   had I had a meeting I was telling   Franklin Graham was a great guy I was   telling Jerry Falwell Jr who's a great   guy great guy I mean so many we had a   meeting where we had 50 to 60 pastors   ministers and they were saying we love   you when they were praying and it was   like this incredible scene and I said   okay well folks can you endorse me well   we can't do that why because we'll lose   our tax exempt status I said why now   nobody brought this up to me they were   living with it nobody was going to go   fight it I said why do you lose your tax   exempt status what we're not allowed to   speak and I said wait and I looked into   it I said whoa and that was passed by   the ultimate politician Lyndon Johnson I   mean it's not like we're dealing with   the Pope this was Lyndon Johnson smart   tough guy but we're smarter and tougher   but look that was passed by a politician   because he had problems with some of the   churches   in Texas where they were going after him   for good reason and I said wait a minute   folks and we put in our platform that   we're going to work like hell to get rid   of the Johnson Amendment because because   your representatives ministers pastors   rabbis they have totally lost their   voice and don't kid yourself that's   what's happening to religion in this   country because you see the same numbers   that I see so I think this if you're   evangelical of your Christian of your   Jewish if you have religion you better   go out and vote for Trump because this   is going to be the last chance you ever   get to get this thing down okay better   so   thank you thank you   thank you   and I said in my I will say this i will   say this i said in my speech the other   night and I meant it I thank the   evangelicals because i won i got these   tremendous votes they say Trump can't   win South Carolina right I said why   because I'd have a piece of tremendous   craft I wonder with evangelicals I want   all over with evangelicals because they   get it they're smart they understand   they know I'm not perfect I'm not   perfect but they know i love them and   they know i'm going to fight for them   better than somebody that is perfect   okay i'm going to fight for it and i'm   going to fight for other religions i'm   going to fight i'm going to fight for   people to be able to speak and actually   when they said this to me i was in an   office building very high up and I'm   looking down and I said to these   powerful pastors and these powerful men   and women just powerful people with   tremendous strength and energy and   conviction and they're so there in the   room and it was beautiful the voices and   I said but that means that you're less   powerful than those people walking down   the street I pointed to the street   because they have a right to talk and   you don't you don't have your right to   talk okay and that's our religion that's   our religion in my case I'm presbyterian   I'm Protestant but but that's our   religion and my minister who are like a   lot doesn't have the right to speak   we're gonna end that folks you get a one   chance we're gonna have it so you better   go back to your churches and you better   get everybody to vote because for years   ago they didn't get up and they didn't   vote for Romney and to this day a lot of   people don't understand some people do   understand it frankly but you better get   up and you better vote because if you   vote if you think about it the if you   take christian jewish take some of the   Catholic take the religions it's bigger   than men and it's bigger than women   right it's bigger than men you know man   of fifty percent women are fifty percent   the religions like what eighty percent   right if you get up and vote we're going   to get rid of that   and we're going to free up great people   to go and speak what they want to speak   about and they should be able to speak   okay very important so just a couple of   things and I'd like to bring my cup just   a couple of things we are going to   strengthen our military and military is   really depleted it's not good I didn't   want to go into Iraq we got there I said   keep the oil they didn't keep the oil   these people don't know what they're   doing you know the old days you're an   award to the victor belong the spoils   right today we get nothing trillions of   dollars in costs thousands and thousands   of lives lost we got nothing Iraq is a   disaster the Middle East is worse now   than it was 15 years ago by a factor of   20 okay we would have done nothing we   would have been much better off we got   to build up our military we never needed   it so much we never needed our military   so much so we're going to take care of   our country we're going to take care of   our vets we're going to take care of our   people we're going to make America great   again and i have to tell you one of the   really good decisions because I laugh   when they say do you think mr.
